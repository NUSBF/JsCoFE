Detaching Windows in CCP4 Cloud
===============================

You may have noticed that the CCP4 Cloud interface uses windows and dialogs 
similar to those in traditional desktop applications. However, by default, 
these windows are confined to the main browser window.

In most cases, this layout works well. However, there are times when you might 
prefer to move a window's contents into a separate browser tab or window — 
for example, to reduce scrolling or to compare information side by side.

CCP4 Cloud allows you to detach windows in the following cases:

1. **Documentation Pages**

   Documentation windows can be detached by clicking the **"Detach"** button 
   located at the bottom of the window. Try looking for it now as you read 
   this guide. Once detached, the documentation remains accessible in a separate 
   tab, which is especially helpful when following tutorials or instructions 
   alongside your main work.

2. **Job Dialogs**

   You can also detach output panels of job dialogs by clicking the *detach* 
   icon in the dialog's toolbar. If you're unsure which one it is, hover over 
   the icons to view their tooltips. Detaching a job dialog can make it easier 
   to inspect or compare job reports without crowding your main workspace.

.. note::

   Detached windows operate independently from your CCP4 Cloud session. As a result, 
   certain features — such as launching new jobs from a detached Job dialog — are 
   unavailable.
