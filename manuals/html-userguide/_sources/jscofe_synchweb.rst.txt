CCP4 Cloud Username and Cloudrun ID
-----------------------------------

CCP4 Cloud's credentials are required to upload files into your CCP4 Cloud storage. These credentials can be accessed by logging in to the CCP4 Cloud web interface and can be found on the CCP4 Cloud account page. The Cloudrun ID is a unique identifier that is used to authenticate the user and is required to upload files to the CCP4 Cloud storage.
