=======================
File name customisation
=======================

CCP4 Cloud generates names for data objects and files automatically, using the following pattern: ::

    [JJJJ-NN] outputId /type/specs
    
where ``JJJJ`` stands for serial number of job that produced the object, ``NN`` is serial number of output data item in that job, ``outputId`` is data object Id, ``type`` is data object type (such as *Structure*) and ``specs`` are optional specificators such as *protein*, *dna*, *anom* and others.

Usually, automatic naming is all what you need, yet, you may find it useful to customise object names for extra annotation and easier data identification in big projects, or when downloading data files for custom processing outside CCP4 Cloud context.

Object names may be customised in two ways.

.. Note::
    Changing object names is not possible if task is already running or has finished.


**Changing object Id**

In most tasks, ``outputId`` is customisable and is used for naming all data objects produced by the task (a few exceptions include import tasks, where ``outputId`` follows the imported file names and, therefore, is different for different objects). By default, ``outputId`` is set to the name of the main program used in the task; it can be found in the *Input tab* of the *Job Dialog*. For example, using default naming in *Refmac* task:

.. image:: images/refmac_fname_default.png
         :scale: 50 %
         :align: center

produces file names like these:

.. image:: images/refmac_fname_default_out.png
         :scale: 50 %
         :align: center

If *output Id* is changed before runnung the task, for example:

.. image:: images/refmac_fname_custom.png
         :scale: 50 %
         :align: center

then the resulting file names will look like:

.. image:: images/refmac_fname_custom_out.png
         :scale: 50 %
         :align: center

.. Note::
    The *job description* field was also changed in the above example. This fields corresponds to job title in the Project's *Job Tree*. Changing job description is possible for jobs in preparation or finished jobs, but not while a job is running.


**Setting the Output Id Prefix**

This customisation is useful if results from a series of alike projects are downloaded and processed out of Cloud context. In order to associate downloaded files with a particular project, sequence, ligand etc., output Ids can be prepended with a chosen Id. For doing this, choose *Project settings* item from the Main menu if the *Project page*. The following prompt will appear:

.. image:: images/project_setings_prefix.png
         :scale: 50 %
         :align: center

after which the default *output id* will be automatically prefixed with the chosen value, for example:

.. image:: images/refmac_fname_prefixed.png
         :scale: 50 %
         :align: center

.. Note::
    Automatic prefixing will work only for newly created (not cloned or already created) jobs.

For extra convenience, automatic prefixing with *project Id* may be set in *My Account* page (look for *Use project name as default prefix* checkbox in *Preferences*), in which case it will be applied to all projects until cancelled.
