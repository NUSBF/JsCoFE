CCP4 Cloud Atlas
================

This atlas presents different ways of solving structures in CCP4 Cloud
depending on available data. Only schematic structure solution projects
are shown, which only demonstrate general scenarios.

For solving a structure, you need at least experimental observations
(reflections) either merged or unmerged. Unmerged reflections must be
scaled and merged with *Aimless* task before use in other programs. 

.. note:: Further actions will vary

.. note:: Atlas projects are available from the *Tutorials* directory
