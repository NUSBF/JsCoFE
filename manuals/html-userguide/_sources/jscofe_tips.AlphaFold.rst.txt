===================================
Using AlphaFold2 and Rosetta models
===================================

CCP4 Cloud tasks automatically recognise AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold models and convert their per-residue pLDDT scores (AlphaFold) or rmsd estimates (RoseTTAFold) to B-factors. `Import <../html-taskref/doc.task.Import.html>`_ task puts a notice of conversion in the *Import Summary* table, other tasks, such as `MrBump <../html-taskref/doc.task.MrBump.html>`_ and `MrParse <../html-taskref/doc.task.MrParse.html>`_, do that silently.

.. note::
        It is important to convert pLLDT scores and rmsd estimates, placed in B-factor columns of predicted models, into B-factors. Without that, best parts of the model will get the lowest weight in Molecular Replacement, which significantly decreases chances for solution. All is done automatically, you are fully set.

                AlphaFold produces a per-residue estimate of its confidence score, called **pLDDT**, ranging from 0 to 100. This option sets the minimum level of **pLDDT** of selected residues.
                
                * **pLDDT > 90**: residues are expected to be positioned with a high accuracy. These models should be suitable for any application that benefits from high accuracy (e.g. characterising binding sites).
                
                * **70 < pLDDT < 90** residues are expected to be positioned reasonably well (generally, a good backbone prediction).
                
                * **50 < pLDDT < 70** corresponds to residues modelled with low confidence, which should be treated with caution.
                
                * **pLDDT < 50** indicates residues that should not be interpreted. Such scores are a reasonably strong predictor of disorder, i.e. they suggest that the region is either unstructured in physiological conditions, or gets structured only as part of a complex.
