Using AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold Models
=======================================

CCP4 Cloud tasks automatically recognize AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold models and convert their per-residue pLDDT scores (AlphaFold) or RMSD estimates (RoseTTAFold) into B-factors. The `Import <../html-taskref/doc.task.Import.html>`_ task provides a notice of this conversion in the *Import Summary* table, while other tasks, such as `MrBump <../html-taskref/doc.task.MrBump.html>`_ and `MrParse <../html-taskref/doc.task.MrParse.html>`_, perform the conversion silently.

.. note::
   It is essential to convert pLDDT scores and RMSD estimates, which are stored in the B-factor columns of predicted models, into actual B-factors. Without this conversion, the best parts of the model would receive the lowest weight in Molecular Replacement, significantly reducing the chances of obtaining a solution. This process is fully automated, so no manual intervention is required.

   AlphaFold generates a per-residue confidence estimate called **pLDDT**, which ranges from 0 to 100. This option sets the minimum threshold for selecting residues based on their pLDDT scores:

   * **pLDDT > 90**: Residues are expected to be positioned with high accuracy. These models are suitable for applications requiring high precision, such as characterizing binding sites.

   * **70 < pLDDT < 90**: Residues are expected to be positioned reasonably well, generally providing a good backbone prediction.

   * **50 < pLDDT < 70**: Residues are modeled with low confidence and should be treated with caution.

   * **pLDDT < 50**: Residues should not be interpreted. These scores strongly indicate disorder, suggesting that the region is either unstructured under physiological conditions or becomes structured only as part of a complex.
