    *Released on 11.08.2020 with CCP4 7.1.003*

    **Changes and new features**

    #. Shared Projects are now joined, rather than imported. This means that
       all users, who share a project, are working on the same copy of it. 
       Simultaneous work of several users on shared projects is supported.
       Only project owners can share, delete or rename their project, other users can
       join or unjoin them in their *Project Lists*.

       Structure Superposition with ``LsqKab``)

    #. ``DIMPLE`` task optimised by eliminating the trailing zero-cycle run of
       ``Refmac``.

    #. Import of sequences from the PDB now produces sequences from both atomic
       coordinates (may be used for automatic construction of the corresponding
       structure revision) and from header annotation (more suitable for making 
       MR search models).

    #. ``XYZ Utils`` can now import sequences from atomic coordinates, task
       interface changed

    #. ``Lorestr`` can now work on structures with ligand molecules


**Version 1.6.012**

    *Released on 03.07.2020 with CCP4 7.1.002*

    **Changes and new features**

    #. CROSSEC task (anomalous scattering factors calculations) now operates with
       both wavelengths and photon energies. In addition to the general plot,
       anomalous scattering factors may be calculated also for up to 6 selected
       wavelengths or photon energies
       
    #. User guidance sections (Verdicts) are added to ASU, Phaser, CCP4Build and
       Refmac task reports
       
    #. Documentation updated
       
    #. Fixed a bug in the import procedure for HHPRED alignments, related to
       mispositioning of residue numbers under certain circumstances
       
    #. CCP4BUILD modified with the purpose to improve convergence and 
       reproduceability of results at repeat runs.
       
    #. Fixed a bug in the import procedure for merged MTZ files, related to 
       python2 / python3 code compatibility
       
    #. Added new task for importing sequences by copy-pasting (Task List
       Section *Data Import*)
       
    #. Cloud path, used in tasks importing data from Cloud storage, is passed as 
       current path to task clones and descendants
       
    #. Fixed a bug, preventing import of certain types of ligand description 
       files and ligand dictionaries
