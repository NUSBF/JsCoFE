    **Changes and new features**

    #. CROSSEC task (anomalous scattering factors calculations) now operates with
       both wavelengths and photon energies. In addition to the general plot,
       anomalous scattering factors may be calculated also for up to 6 selected
       wavelengths or photon energies
       
    #. Fixed a bug in the import procedure for HHPRED alignments, related to
       mispositioning of residue numbers under certain circumstances
       
    #. CCP4BUILD modified with the purpose to improve convergence and 
       reproduceability of results at repeat runs.
