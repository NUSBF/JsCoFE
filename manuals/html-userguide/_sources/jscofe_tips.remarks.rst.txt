Using Remarks
=============

Remarks are a great tool for keeping your Projects annotated, which helps understanding them after a period of time. Adding a remark is easy, just click on the Remark button in the vertical toolbar in the Project Page, or right-click on job to be annotated and choose "Add remark" from the drop-down menu.

Remarks may look like jobs in the Project Tree, but there are a few differences to bear in mind about them:

- remarks are transparent for the data flows in the Project Tree, they take no data and produce no data 
- it is possible to add a task to remark; however, the task will be actually added to job annotated by the remark 
- attempt to add a task to job annotated by a remark will result in adding the task to the remark; there is no difference between adding a task to job or to remark annotating that job 
- it is not possible to add a remark to another remark
- it is possible to add a remark to a job in the middle of already developed Project Tree
- remarks may deleted just as if the were jobs; however, in difference of deleting jobs, deleting a remark *does not* cause deletion of all the descending branch of the Project Tree
- not only remark title, displayed in the Project Tree, but also remark's content, may be changed or corrected at any time
- remark's colour may be changed: open Remark Dialog by double-clicking on the remark, and click on Remark icon in the Dialog to choose the colour 
- remarks may be cloned, and this is the only way to attach more than one remark to a job. This feature is useful for the annotation of branching Projects as in the following picture (remark 0009 obtained by cloning and editing remark 0005):
