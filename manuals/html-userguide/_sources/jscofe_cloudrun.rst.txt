.. _cloudrun:

==================================================
Starting CCP4 Cloud projects from the command line
==================================================

CCP4 Cloud projects can be initiated and executed from the command line, which may be useful in many scenarious. For example, data collection session at a synchrotron beamline may include sending reflection data, sequence, optional structural homolog and ligand descriptions, automatically to the specified CCP4 Cloud account and starting a suitable structure solution workflow in it. Or, large series of structure solution projects can be initiated by custom script to save time for manipulations with CCP4 Cloud's graphical interface.

.. note::
  Functionality, described in this article, requires local CCP4 setup version 8.0.003 or higher.


----------------
CloudRun utility
----------------

CloudRun utility, included in `CCP4 Software Suite <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/download/>`_, can create projects, upload data and start automatic structure solution workflow in a single run as shown below (CCP4 8.0.003+ environment is assumed on Linux/Mac OSX, **use CCP4 Console** on Windows): ::

  $ cloudrun -c command_file

where ``command_file`` is a text file with instructions given as keyword-value pairs (described below). An alternative syntax may also be used: ::

  $ cloudrun -i <<eof
  keyword value
  .......
  eof 

in which case the set of keyword-value pairs is supplied in the standard input stream.

The set of instructions in ``command_file`` depends on the required task and can be obtained with the following command: ::

  $ cloudrun -t task > command_file

where ``task`` is one of:

  - ``import``: create standard project, `import data <../html-taskref/doc.task.Import.html>`_ and stop 
  - ``hop-on``: create `hop-on <../html-taskref/doc.task.Migrate.html>`_ project, import data and stop
  - ``auto-af2``: create standard project, import data and start `Auto-MR workflow <../html-taskref/doc.task.WFlowAMR.html>`_ based on structure prediction with AlphaFold-2
  - ``auto-mr``: create standard project, import data and start `Auto-MR workflow <../html-taskref/doc.task.WFlowAMR.html>`_ utilising `MrBump <../html-taskref/doc.task.MrBump.html>`_ and `Simbad <../html-taskref/doc.task.Simbad.html>`_ pipelines
  - ``auto-ep``: create standard project, import data and start `Auto-EP workflow <../html-taskref/doc.task.WFlowAEP.html>`_ based in `Crank-2 <../html-taskref/doc.task.Crank2.html>`_ pipeline
  - ``auto-ref``: create standard project, import data and start `Auto-REL workflow <../html-taskref/doc.task.WFlowREL.html>`_ , performing automatic structure refinement with optimization of Refmac parameters and fitting water molecules
  - ``dimple``: create standard project, import data and start `Dimple <../html-taskref/doc.task.Dimple.html>`_ workflow for fast ligand blob identification and fitting

Example: ::

  $ cloudrun -t auto-af2 > auto-af2.com
  $ cat auto-af2.com
  # CloudRun template command file for auto-af2 task.
  #
  # The task uploads files specified, creates CCP4 Cloud Project (if it
  # does not exist already) and starts the "Auto-AFMR" workflow (this
  # requires an AlphaFold (or OpenFold or ColabFold) to be installed 
  # in CCP4 Cloud).
  #
  # Notes: a) hash indicates a comment b) line order is insignificant
  #        c) CloudRun tasks are added at Project's root.
  #
  URL         https://ccp4cloud.server    # mandatory
  #
  # User authentication: either in-line specification
  #
  USER        user_login                  # mandatory
  CLOUDRUN_ID aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd         # mandatory, found in "My Account"
  #
  # or reading user_login and aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd (in that order)
  # from a file:
  # AUTH_FILE   /path/to/auth.dat         # mandatory
  #
  PROJECT     project_id                  # mandatory
  TITLE       Optional Project Title      # used only if project is created
  TASK        auto-af2                    # mandatory
  TASK_NAME   Optional Task Name          # if not given, default name is used
  #
  HKL         /path/to/hkl.mtz               # reflection data
  SEQ_PROTEIN /path/to/file.[seq|fasta|pir]  # protein sequence
  #
  # Either SMILES or LIG_CODE should be used for optional ligand description,
  # but not both.
  #
  SMILES      smiles-string  # ligand smiles string, not enquoted
  LIG_CODE    ATP            # 3-letter ligand code, e.g., ATP
  $

**The use of CloudRun utility is capped by the maximum number of runs per day** (*configurable*).

.. important:: The remaining number of available runs is shown in CCP4 Cloud pages only if it is less than the maximum. 

.. note:: The CloudRun quota may be adjusted by CCP4 Cloud administrator for individual users.


---------------------
Command file keywords
---------------------

**URL**
    *(mandatory)* 
    
    CCP4 Cloud server URL, for example: ::
    
        URL   https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk


**USER**
    *(mandatory unless* `AUTH_FILE`_ *is used)*
    
    CCP4 Cloud's user account name, for example: ::
    
        USER   my.user.name

**CLOUDRUN_ID**
    *(mandatory unless* `AUTH_FILE`_ *is used)*
    
    CloudRun Id is unique for each user: ::
    
        CLOUDRUN_ID   aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd 

    **The CloudRun ID may be found in the users's "My Account" page** in CCP4 Cloud. The page 
    also allows a user to change their CloudRun ID if necessary.  

.. _AUTH_FILE:


**AUTH_FILE**



    *(mandatory if USER and CLOUDRUN_ID keywords are not used)* 
    
    Path to file with user authorisation information, for example: ::
    
        AUTH_FILE   /path/to/auth.dat

    where ``/path/to/auth.dat`` should contain user's login name and Cloudrun Id, in that order,
    for example: ::

        my.user.name   aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd 

    .. note:: Using ``AUTH_FILE`` instead of keyword pair ``USER`` and ``CLOUDRUN_ID`` is recommended 
       if a collection of cloudrun scripts should be maintained and/or exchanged between users.

**PROJECT**
    *(mandatory)* 
    
    Project Id, where the data should be imported, for example: ::
    
        PROJECT   cloudrun-amr

**TITLE**
    *(mandatory for new projects)* 
    
    Project title, which is used for creating new project, for example: ::
    
        TITLE   Auto-MR Project started with CloudRun utility

**TASK**
    *(optional)* 
    
    The task that should be performed after data is uploaded. 
    
    Can be one of ``import``, ``auto-af2``, ``auto-mr``, ``auto-ep``, ``hop-on``, ``auto-ref`` or ``dimple``,
    as described above.
    
    Example: ::

        TASK  auto-mr 

    .. note:: if ``TASK`` is not given, ``import`` is assumed.     
    
**HA_TYPE**

    *(must be given for auto-ep task)* 
    
    Atom type of main anomalous scatterer, for example: ::
    
        HA_TYPE   Se
    
**FILE**
    *(required)* 
    
    Path to file that should be uploaded, for example: ::
    
        FILE   /path/to/file/my_file.mtz 

    The following files extensions are acceptable: ``.mtz``, ``.pdb``, ``.seq``, ``.fasta``,
    ``.pir``, ``.cif``.

    .. note::
        CCP4 Cloud will attempt to identify the file content automatically. This should work in most cases, yet confusion
        may arise when complex MTZ file (combining several datasets and/or phases), non-protein sequences or CIF files are
        uploaded. In order to avoid possible ambiguity, use specific keywords described below. 

**HKL**
    Path to MTZ or CIF file with reflection data, for example: ::
    
        HKL  /path/to/file.mtz

**PHASES**
    Path to MTZ file with phases, for example: ::
    
        PHASES  /path/to/file.mtz

    Phases are usually required in the ``hop-on`` task.

**SEQ_PROTEIN**
    Path to file with aminoacid sequence(s), for example: ::
    
        SEQ_PROTEIN  /path/to/file_protein.seq 
        
    The following file extensions are accepted: ``.seq``, ``.fasta``, ``.pir``.
    
    .. note::
        The file may contain several aminoacid sequences in FASTA/PIR formats, but it **must not** include nucleic acid 
        sequence(s)

**SEQ_DNA**
    Path to file with DNA sequence, for example: ::
    
        SEQ_DNA    /path/to/file_dna.seq

    The following file extensions are accepted: ``.seq``, ``.fasta``, ``.pir``. 
    
    .. note:: Only DNA sequence(s) must be found in the file.

**SEQ_RNA**
    Path to file with RNA sequence, for example: ::
    
        SEQ_RNA    /path/to/file_rna.seq

    The following file extensions are accepted: ``.seq``, ``.fasta``, ``.pir``. 
    
    .. note:: Only RNA sequence(s) must be found in the file.

**XYZ**
    Path to file with macromolecular atomic model, for example: ::
    
        XYZ    /path/to/file_xyz.pdb

    Acceptable file extensions include ``.pdb`` and ``.cif``.

**LIGAND**
    File with ligand descriptors (crystallographic restraints), for example: ::
    
        LIGAND   /path/to/file_ligand.cif

    Both single-ligand (``.cif``) and multiple-ligand ("libraries", ``.lib``) files are acceptable.

**SMILES**
    SMILES string for generating ligand descriptors. For example, benzene is specified as follows: ::
    
        SMILES   C1=CC=CC=C1

**LIG_CODE**
    3-character ligand code. For example: ::
    
        LIG_CODE  ATP

    .. note::
        ``SMILES`` and ``LIG_CODE`` are mutually exclusive and can be used only for describing a single
        ligand that should be fitted in a structure solution workflow. For ``hop-on`` and ``import``
        tasks, use ``LIGAND`` keyword instead.

**LOAD_PROJECT**
    Instruction to load project, created by CloudRun utility, in browser (by default, ``NO``). For example: ::

        LOAD_PROJECT  YES

    .. note::
        The project will be loaded in browser only if browser was displaying the *Project List Page* when
        the CloudRun utility was run.

Example
-------

The following commands will import data and start automatic Molecular Replacement workflow including the
generation of AlphaFold-2 model and ligand fitting, for solving MDM2 Protein bound to Nutlin molecule
from the standard set of CCP4 examples: ::

  $ source /path/to/ccp4-8.0/bin/ccp4.setup-sh
  $ export CDEMODATA=`ccp4-python -c "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_path('purelib'))"`/ccp4i2/demo_data
  $ cp $CDEMODATA/mdm2/mdm2_unmerged.mtz .
  $ cp $CDEMODATA/mdm2/4hg7.seq .
  $ cloudrun -i <<eof
  URL         https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk
  USER        my.ccp4.cloud.login
  CLOUDRUN_ID aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd
  PROJECT     cloudrun_mdm2
  TITLE       Solving MDM2 Protein bound to Nutlin molecule for testing CloudRun
  TASK        auto-af2
  HKL         mdm2_unmerged.mtz
  SEQ_PROTEIN 4hg7.seq
  SMILES      COc1ccc(C2=N[C@H]([C@H](N2C(=O)N2CCNC(=O)C2)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)c(OC(C)C)c1
  eof

.. note::
  Use your actual CCP4 Cloud login name and cloudrun id in ``USER`` and ``CLOUDRUN_ID`` fields; both can be found in 
  "My Account" page in CCP4 Cloud.

.. note::
  AlphaFold-2 is not part of CCP4 and should be installed in CCP4 Cloud separately. It is installed at
  CCP4 Cloud instance is supported by CCP4 (https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk), but it may be unavailable on other servers.
  In this case, this example is solvable by changing TASK from ``auto-af2`` to ``auto-mr``.
