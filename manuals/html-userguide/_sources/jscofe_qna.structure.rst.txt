====================
What is *Structure*?
====================

In CCP4 Cloud, *Structure* refers to an entity that combines atomic coordinates, 
phases, and electron density maps, providing comprehensive information about a 
crystal structure.  

Since this information may be incomplete at certain stages of a structure solution 
project, it is possible to encounter **Structure objects** without coordinates or 
without phases and electron density maps.

----------------------------
*Structure* Creation and Development
----------------------------

In most cases, *Structure* is initially generated by one of the phasing or auto-solve tasks 
and becomes part of the corresponding **Structure Revision**.  

As the structure solution project progresses, *Structure* is passed from one task to another, 
gradually improving until the crystal structure is considered complete and final.

---------------------
*Scope and Visibility*
---------------------

Once a *Structure* is produced by a task, it becomes accessible to all descendant tasks. This allows:

- Comparison of *Structures* created at different project stages
- Combining properties of multiple *Structures*, such as for MR-SAD phasing

-----------------------
*Structure* Naming
-----------------------

Like any other data object in CCP4 Cloud, *Structures* are named according to the following format:

``[0255-01] refmac /structure/``

Explanation:

- ``0255``: Serial number of the job that produced the *Structure*  
- ``01``: Serial number of the output data item from that job  
- ``refmac``: Task name (either generic or user-provided)  
- ``/structure/``: Indicates that this data object is a *Structure*

----------------------------------------------
Difference Between *Structure* and *Structure Revision*
----------------------------------------------

In CCP4 Cloud, the key distinctions are:

- **Structure:** Describes the crystal structure, defined by a combination of atomic coordinates, phases, and electron density.  
- **Structure Revision:** Represents the state of the structure solution project, encompassing both experimental and generated data along a project branch.

**A Structure Revision includes a Structure as one of its components.**  
Effectively, a *Structure Revision* acts as a checkpoint in the project, while a *Structure* describes the crystal structure itself.
