====================
What is *Structure*?
====================

In CCP4 Cloud, *Structure* refers to entity that combines atomic coordinates, 
phases and electron density maps, by this giving the full information about 
crystal structure. This information may be incomplete at certain stages of 
structure solution project, therefore, it is possible to have **Structure 
objects** without coordinates or without phases and electron density maps.

In most cases, *Structure* is initially produced by one of phasing or auto-solve 
tasks, and becomes a part of the corresponding **Structure Revision**. As
structure solution project develops, *Structure* is passed from one task to
another and gets gradually improved until crystal structure is considered as
complete and final.

**Scope and visibility**

Once produced in a given task, *Structure* is available to all descendants of
that task. Therefore, it is possible to compare *Structures* produced at 
different points of the project, and combine their properties, for example,
for MR-SAD phasing.

**Structure naming**

*Structures* are named as any other data object in CCP4 Cloud, for example: ::

    [0255-01] refmac /structure/
    
where ``0255`` stands for serial number of job that produced the *Structure*, 
``01`` is serial number of output data item in that job, ``refmac`` is task 
name of the job (either generic or provided by user), and suffix ``structure`` 
indicates that this data object is *Structure*.

**What is the difference between Structure and Structure Revision?**

In CCP4 Cloud, *Structure* provides description of crystal structure (a combination
of atomic coordinates, phases and electron density), and *Structure Revision*
represents the state of structure solution project in terms of data, both 
experimental and generated along given branch of the project. *Structure Revision*
includes *Structure* as one of its items.
