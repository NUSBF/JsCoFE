====================
What is *Structure*?
====================

In CCP4 Cloud, *Structure* refers to an entity that combines atomic coordinates,  phases and electron density maps, by this giving the full information about crystal structure. This information may be incomplete at certain stages of  structure solution project, therefore, it is possible to have **Structure  objects** without coordinates or without phases and electron density maps.

In most cases, *Structure* is initially produced by one of phasing or auto-solve  tasks, and becomes a part of the corresponding **Structure Revision**. As structure solution project develops, *Structure* is passed from one task to another and gets gradually improved until crystal structure is considered as complete and final.

**Scope and visibility**

Once produced in a given task, *Structure* is available to all descendants of that task. Therefore, it is possible to compare *Structures* produced at  different points of the project, and combine their properties, for example, for MR-SAD phasing.

**Structure naming**

*Structures* are named like any other data object in CCP4 Cloud, for example: ::

    [0255-01] refmac /structure/
    
where ``0255`` stands for the serial number of the job that produced the *Structure*, ``01`` is the serial number of the output data item in that job ``refmac`` is the task  name of the job (either generic or provided by the user), and suffix ``structure`` indicates that this data object is *Structure*.

**What is the difference between Structure and Structure Revision?**

In CCP4 Cloud, *Structure* provides a description of crystal structure (a combination
of atomic coordinates, phases and electron density), and *Structure Revision*
represents the state of the structure solution project in terms of data, both 
experimental and generated along given branch of the project. *Structure Revision*
includes *Structure* as one of its items.
