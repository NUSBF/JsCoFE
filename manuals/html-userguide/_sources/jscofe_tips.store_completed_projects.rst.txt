How to store completed projects
===============================

Projects in CCP4 cloud can be exported and store as compressed file archive using the |Export| button

Exported archives can be uploaded later to your CCP4 Cloud account using the |Import| button above the project list.

Exporting projects may be needed if there is no disk space left in your account, personal archival, or for transferring data to another CCP4 Cloud setup.

Beware that projects usually grow to a considerable size, from 100s MBs to few GBs. You will be advised about the project size before downloading.


.. note:: Web-only and Remote modes share same projects, while the Desktop mode has own set of projects. Desktop projects are not synced with the Web-only/Remote projects. The only way to exchange projects between Desktop and server modes is through the explicit Export/Import procedure.

The |desktop| ccp4cloud-desktop mode may be conveniently used for collecting projects finished in Web-only/Remote modes. **After transferring projects to the** |desktop| **Desktop mode, they may be deleted in the server (remote) Cloud area in order to release the online disk space quota for new projects.** 

.. note:: Exported projects are cross-compatible with all Windows, Linux and Mac OSX systems.
