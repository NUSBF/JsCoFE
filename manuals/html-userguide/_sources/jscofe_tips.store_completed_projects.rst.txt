How to store completed projects
===============================

Projects in CCP4 cloud can be exported and stored as compressed file archives using the |Export| button
above the *Project List*. Exported archives can be re-imported later using the |Import| button found 
in the same place.

Exporting projects may be needed if there is no disk space left in your account, personal archival,
or for transferring data to another CCP4 Cloud setup.

Beware that projects usually grow to a considerable size, from 100s MBs to few GBs. You will be
advised about project size before downloading.


.. note:: Web-only and Remote modes share same projects, while the Local mode has own set of projects. Local projects are not synced with the Web-only/Remote projects. The only way to exchange projects between Desktop and server modes is through the explicit Export/Import procedure.

The |desktop| ccp4cloud-local mode may be conveniently used for collecting projects finished in Web-only/Remote modes. **After transferring projects to the** |desktop| **Local mode, they may be deleted in the server (remote) Cloud area in order to release the online disk space quota for new projects.** 

.. note:: Exported projects are cross-compatible with all Windows, Linux and Mac OSX systems.
