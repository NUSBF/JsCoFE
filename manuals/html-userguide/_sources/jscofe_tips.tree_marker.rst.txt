Project Tree Marker
===================

Marker tool is accessible via |marker| button in the vertical toolbar located
on the left-hand side of the *Project Page*. The button toggles highlighting of
the project branch that contains the currently selected job. The branch is traced
from the selected job up to the root of the *Project tree*, and down to the end
of the job having maximal job number in the branch.

Marker tool is useful for navigating in large projects with extensive branching. 
Main use cases include the following:

- inferring on the pre-history of the currently selected job, which also suggests 
  what data from upstream jobs is available

- trimming the *Project tree*, *e.g.,* before archiving, by removing branches not
  leading to final result

- finding the last job: just select the root node and click on the marker tool
  button.

.. Note::
   To remove highlighting, just click the marker button again,
