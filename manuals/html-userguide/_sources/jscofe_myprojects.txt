First time
----------

This is the page you find yourself in immediately after login. If you read this text first time ever, you are probably new to CCP4 Cloud, just logged in with a temporary password sent to you after registration. If so, the first thing you want to do is to change your temporary password for something memorisable. You do not have to do that -- your temporary password won't expire -- but if you do, look for the Menu icon: |menu| in the top-left corner of the page. Click on it, then choose **"My Account"** from the dropdown menu, and you will be presented with your account settings. Choose and type your new password in there, press button **"Update my account"** , and job's done. You will be then taken to CCP4 Cloud's home page in order to login with your new password.

Projects
--------

In CCP4 Cloud, your work is arranged in Projects. There is no strict rules how to use them, but a good practice would be to put all work, related to a particular protein, into one Project. Projects start with uploading experimental data and subsequent jobs along the following line:

    *data processing*
    
    *phasing (MR or EP)*
    
    *density modification*
    
    *model building*
    
    *refinement*
    
    *validation and deposition*

Getting started
---------------

he page shows the list of projects, which is empty at start. Press |addjob| button in the button line above the list, and create your first project. You will need to specify short project name, and a more descriptive title in the dialog appeared, for example:

.. image:: images/add_project.png
         :scale: 50 %
         :align: center
         
then press |addjob| and see the new project appeared in the list.

The project list is both sortable (use controls found in column titles) and selectable. In order to open a particular Project, select it and press |openjob|  button on top of the list or, alternatively, just double-click on the project line.

You can delete your projects as well: simply select unwanted project in the list and press |delete| button. Do this with due care: once deleted, projects cannot be restored.

Project export and import
-------------------------

.. |Import| image:: images/task_import.png

Using the |Export| button, you can download the selected project as a compressed TAR archive. Exported archives can be uploaded later to your CCP4 Cloud account using the |Import| button above the project list.

Exporting projects may be needed if there is no disk space left in your account, personal archival or for transferring data to another CCP4 Cloud setup.

Beware that projects usually grow to a considerable size, from 100s MBs to few GBs. You will be advised about the project size before downloading.

After work
----------

.. |logout| image:: images/logout.png
    :width: 16
    :height: 16

Whenever you wish to end working with CCP4 Cloud, please ``do logout`` . This can be done through the Menu or by clicking on the exit button |logout| in the top-right corner. Doing so will ensure that all your data and projects will be found in exactly the same state as you left them. 

Do not worry about jobs still running: they will not be terminated if you quit your working session.

.. Note::
    CCP4 Cloud does not support multiple logins of the same user. Each login will forcefully terminate any other session of the same user still open.
