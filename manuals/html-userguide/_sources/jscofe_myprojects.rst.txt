First Time

This is the first page you see after logging in. If this is your first time using CCP4 Cloud, you have likely logged in with a temporary password sent after registration. Although the temporary password does not expire, you may want to change it to something memorable.

To update your password:
1. Click the Menu icon: |menu| in the top-left corner of the page.
2. Select **"My Account"** from the dropdown menu.
3. Enter your new password in the account settings and press **"Update my account"**.

Once updated, you will be redirected to the CCP4 Cloud home page, where you can log in with your new password.

Software Authorisation

CCP4 Cloud integrates certain third-party software that requires user authorisation from the respective software provider. You can manage authorisations on the **"My Account"** page.

2. This page provides a summary of your authorisations and allows you to send authorisation requests.

.. Note::
   Authorisation requests will redirect you to the software provider's website. Any data provided is processed directly by the provider and is not stored in CCP4 Cloud.

Projects
--------

In CCP4 Cloud, your work is organised into **Projects**. While there are no strict rules for their usage, a common approach is to create a separate project for each protein. Projects typically follow a workflow:

- **Data Processing**
- **Phasing (MR or EP)**
- **Density Modification**
- **Model Building**
- **Refinement**
- **Validation and Deposition**
