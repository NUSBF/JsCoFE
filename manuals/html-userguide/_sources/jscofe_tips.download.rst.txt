Using the |Export| button, you can download the selected project as a compressed archive. Exported archives can be uploaded later to your CCP4 Cloud account using the |Import| button above the project list.

Exporting projects may be needed if there is no disk space left in your account, personal archival, or for transferring data to another CCP4 Cloud setup.

Beware that projects usually grow to a considerable size, from 100s MBs to a few GBs. You will be advised about the project size before downloading.

**Export Job data**

Using the |Export| button in task menu (1), you can download the selected job as a compressed ZIP archive. You will be advised about the archive size before downloading.
