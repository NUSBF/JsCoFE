====================================
Login in Project or List of Projects
====================================

By default, after login procedure you find yourself in your List of Projects ("My Projects"), from where you'd typically go to the Project that you were developing the day before.

Instead, you may configure CCP4 Cloud such that it brings you to your last Project upon login automatically:

- go to "My Account" (using Main Menu button in the top-left corner of the screen)
- choose "last project" in the "Preferences/On login"
- type your password in "My Account" settings and push buton "Save changes"

You can restore the default behaviour at any time using the same procedure.
