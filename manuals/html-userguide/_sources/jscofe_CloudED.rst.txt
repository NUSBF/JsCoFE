CCP4 Cloud education capabilities
=================================

CCP4 Cloud is not only a powerful tool for maintaining crystallographic projects 
in CCP4 but also a platform for gaining knowledge about CCP4 tasks you are running.

--------------------
CCP4 Cloud tutorials
--------------------

On the My Projects page toolbox, you can find a **Tutorial** |tutorials| icon. 
Click on it and you can import Tutorials or Demo projects of interest to 
your :ref:`project page<myprojects>`

**Tutorials** include examples designed to demonstrate structure solution 
techniques in CCP4 Cloud. Tutorials are presented as seed projects with 
pre-loaded data, which can be imported into the account. Each tutorial has 
instructions that will guide you through the required project development stages. 

Please find a list of all tutorials available `here <../html-tutorials/doc.tutorials.html>`__

task documentation you can find by clicking the **Task documentation** |reference| 
button on the Job dialog window

The main purpose of task documentation is to gain knowledge of CCP4 task 
capabilities and to improve your experience of using CCP4 tasks. Task 
documentation not only will guide you on more efficient ways to use the 
whole potential of CCP4 tasks but also help you to enrich a knowledge base 
about ways is used to accomplish the task.

        on **Contents** on your upright corner of the window. The content 
        page contains all available list task documentation
