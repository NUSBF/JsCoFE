AlphaFold and structure solution in CCP4 Cloud
==============================================

`AlphaFold2 <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2>`_ and `RosettaFold <https://robetta.bakerlab.org/>`_ predicted models are widely acknowledged as good structure templates for Molecular Replacement (MR). This article describes AlphaFold implementation and the use of predicted models, regardless of their origin, in CCP4 Cloud. Good news are, CCP4 Cloud automates most operations with predicted models, and using them has very differences from models prepared from experimentally determined structures.

---------------------------------------------
AlphaFold and Automatic Molecular Replacement
---------------------------------------------

The easiest way of solving structure in CCP4 is through using one of automatic MR pipelines: MrBump, MorDA or BALBES. They find structural homologs by sequence search, prepare them as MR search models (templates) by removing structural features that are less likely to be found in target structure, and then try them for MR.

MrBump will find structural homologs in both PDB and AlphaFold Database (AFDB) from the EBI, completely automatically. ModDA and BALBES do not offer this functionality at present.

-----------------------------------------
AlphaFold and Automated Project Workflows
-----------------------------------------

CCP4 Cloud projects can be developed automatically using Automated Project Workflows (APWs). They perform typical sequence of tasks and user's actions depending on available data. Automatic project development is available for Auto-MR (WAMR), MR with model (WSMR), auto-EP (WAEP), MR with model prediction (WAFMR) and Dimple MR (WDMR).

WAMR uses MrBump as the structure solution element, and will use AlphaFold-predicted models from AFDB completely automatically.

WAFMR uses AlphaFold through the Structure Prediction task for generating MR template, which is then feed in Phaser. This process is completely automatic and does not need any intervention from the user.

WSMR requires a template MR model on input. Either a model derived from experimentally determined or AlphaFold predicted structure can be used, without any additional actions from the user.

.. note::
    In difference of standard PDB files, predicted models contain confidence scores (pLLDT in AlphaFold case and rmsd estimates in case of RoseTTAFold), placed in B-factor column. This confuses MR programs, and, therefore, the scores must be recalculated as B-factors. Everywhere in CCP4 Cloud, this recalculation is done completely automatically and seamlessly for the user. If a predicted model is imported into project, conversion to B-factors will be confirmed in the import summary table.


------------------------------------------
AlphaFold and Manual Molecular Replacement
------------------------------------------

When automatic approaches fail, solution may be still obtainable through custom manipulation with MR models and MR programs (Phaser, Molrep and pipelines based on them (Slice-n-Dice, MorDA)). This approach requires more effort but gives access to various program parameters that can improve chances for solution. You will need to perform the following steps.

-----------------------------------
Generate or obtain predicted models
-----------------------------------

Not only CCP4 Cloud allows `import <../html-taskref/doc.task.Import.html>`__ of predicted models but it also allows to generate models for further use in molecular replacement programs (`Phaser <../html-taskref/doc.task.Phaser.html>`_ and `Molrep <../html-taskref/doc.task.Molrep.html>`_)

In order to **generate models** CCP4 Cloud offers a following tasks:

#. `Structure Prediction <../html-taskref/doc.task.StructurePrediction.html>`_ task, which uses AlphaFold-2 for generating structure models from a given sequence.

    .. image:: images/structure_presiction_all_tasks.png
         :scale: 50 %
         :align: center



    After importing or generating the model using `Prepare MR Model(s) from Coordinate data <../html-taskref/doc.task.ModelPrepXYZ.html>`_ task prepares MR search model(s) using predicted models.

#. `Find and prepare MR models with MrParse <../html-taskref/doc.task.MrParse.html>`_ task identifies structural homologs, suitable for making MR search models, in the PDB and **AlphaFold2 Data Base**. Relevant structures are selected on the basis of sequence alignment with `PHMMER <http://hmmer.org/>`_ software.

#. `Prepare MR Ensemble with CCP4mg <../html-taskref/doc.task.EnsemblePrepMG.html>`_ task uses `MrBump <../html-taskref/doc.task.MrBump.html>`__ software to make the `MR Ensemble <../html-taskref/doc.task.Ensembler.html>`_ from given structural homologs. MR Ensembles are obtained with an alignment and truncation procedure using homologues structures found in the PDB and **AlphaFold2 DataBase** with a sequence-based search.

#. `Prepare MR Ensemble from Sequence <../html-taskref/doc.task.EnsemblePrepSeq.html>`_ task uses `MrBump <../html-taskref/doc.task.MrBump.html>`__ software to prepare `MR Ensemble <../html-taskref/doc.task.Ensembler.html>`_ for the given target sequence. The process is completely automatic and includes finding suitable structure homologs in the PDB and, optionally, **AlphaFold2 DataBase**, trimming them, and bringing in the best superposition.


-----------------------
Process predicted model
-----------------------

Inaccuracy in domain-domain orientations is often a key limitation when using predicted models for MR. `Split MR model with Slice-n-Dice <../html-taskref/doc.task.Slice.html>`_ task allows to slice of predicted models into distinct structural units which are then can be placed in an automatic MR pipeline.


-------------------------------
Automated Molecular Replacement
-------------------------------

Automated Molecular Replacement pipelines **search for homologous structures in n PDB and AlphaFold DataBase**, **create a set of suitable search models** from the template structures, **perform molecular replacement**, and **test the solutions** with some rounds of restrained refinement.

The following Automated Molecular Replacement in CCP4 cloud support AlphaFold DataBase search:

#. `MrBump's <../html-taskref/doc.task.MrBump.html>`__ model search is obtained with an alignment and truncation procedure using homologues structures found in the `PDB <https://www.rcsb.org/>`_ and `AlphaFold DataBase <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2>`_ with a sequence-based search.

#. `MR with model splitting using Slice-n-Dice <../html-taskref/doc.task.SliceNDice.html>`_ task designed to pre-process `AlphaFold2 <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2>`_ and `RosettaFold <https://robetta.bakerlab.org/>`_ models by removing low confidence regions and converting confidence scores into predicted B-factors. It also slices predicted models into distinct structural units and then automatically places the slices using `Phaser <../html-taskref/doc.task.Phaser.html>`_. The slicing step can use AlphaFold2’s predicted aligned error (PAE) or can operate via a variety of Cɑ atom clustering algorithms, extending applicability to structures of any origin. **Slice-n-Dice helps to deal with inaccuracy in domain-domain orientations of predicted models.**

#. `Arcimboldo Shredder <../html-taskref/doc.task.ArcimboldoShredder.html>`_ automatically pre-process an Alphafold or RoseTTAFold model by eliminating unstructured and disconnected areas and verifies MR solution.

----------
Refinement
----------

As a final step in the process of solving a macromolecular crystal structure, refinement is carried out to maximize the agreement between the model and the X-ray data. In order to perform structure refinement at low resolution (lower than around 3 Å) it is necessary to use as much available information about macromolecules as possible. `Low-Resolution Refinement with Lorestr <../html-taskref/doc.task.Lorestr.html>`_ task uses **AlphaFold2 DataBase** to identify homologues and then Lorestr uses them in order to determine the set of most appropriate refinement parameters. 

-------------------
Automatic workflows
-------------------

In order to understand how AlphaFold2 can be implemented in a structure solution CCP4 Clouds offers an automatic project **workflow: Molecular Replacement with AlphaFold Model** which starts with data import and then uses `Structure Prediction <../html-taskref/doc.task.StructurePrediction.html>`_ and `MR with model splitting using Slice-n-Dice <../html-taskref/doc.task.SliceNDice.html>`_ tasks to automatically create the structure solution project automatically. The result may be further improved with the elementary tasks in manual mode, allowing finer control over the task's parameters.
