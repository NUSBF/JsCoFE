Automatic workflows
===================

Automatic workflows feature structure solution scenarios, such as Molecular
Replacement or Experimental Phasing, which include several elementary tasks.
A workflow can start with data import and then attempt phasing, model building,
refinement, ligand fitting, solvent modeling, and preparing results for PDB
deposition.

A workflow will develop the *Project Tree* and perform all elementary steps
automatically, exploring different ways of structure solutions and using various
tasks as appropriate. For data of sufficiently high resolution, completeness
and quality (no crystal pathologies), the automatic workflow can produce a
reasonable approximation to the final structure. The result may be further
improved with elementary task in manual mode, allowing finer control over
tasks' parameters.

Not only the workflows can reduce chores, but they may also be used for a 
better understanding of the structure solution strategy.

-------------------------
Using Automatic Workflows
-------------------------

Automatic Workflows progress automatically, creating and running new tasks
and branching as necessary. If a workflow task fails or does not produce 
useable results, the follow-up task is not formed and the corresponding
*Project branch* terminates. Depending on the workflow logic, the algorithm 
attempt another approach (by starting another *Project branch*) or stops.

A user can:

- inspect any workflow job at any time without waiting for the workflow and
  job to finish
- stop any workflow job, which will stop the corresponding workflow branch
- clone a workflow job, whether running, finished, failed or terminated, 
  modify its parameters and re-run. *Such cloned job may be run as part of
  the workflow (forming a new workflow branch), or in the standard (one-off,
  manual) mode*
- use results of any workflow job for further development of the structure
  solution *Project*, irrespectively of whether the workflow has run to the
  last step or not, and in parallel to workflow running.
