Automatic Workflows
===================

Automatic workflows are designed to facilitate structure solution processes,
such as based on Molecular Replacement or Experimental Phasing, by automating 
the corresponding tasks. These workflows can begin with data import and progress
through phasing, model building, refinement, ligand fitting, solvent modeling, 
and preparing results for PDB deposition.

A workflow will develop the *Project Tree* and execute all elementary steps 
automatically, exploring different approaches to structure solution and using 
the appropriate tasks as needed. For data with sufficiently high resolution, 
completeness, and quality (i.e., free from crystal pathologies), the automatic 
workflow can provide a good approximation of the final structure. The result 
can then be further refined in manual mode, which offers more control over the 
parameters of individual tasks.

Workflows not only help reduce repetitive tasks but can also provide valuable 
insights into the structure solution strategy.

-------------------------
Using Automatic Workflows
-------------------------

Automatic Workflows progress by automatically creating and running tasks, 
branching as needed. If a task fails or produces unusable results, the 
subsequent task will not be executed, and the corresponding *Project branch* 
will terminate. Depending on the workflowâ€™s design, the algorithm may attempt 
an alternative approach (by starting a new *Project branch*) or stop altogether.

Users can:

- Inspect any workflow job at any time, without waiting for the workflow or job to complete.
- Stop any workflow job, which will halt the corresponding workflow branch.
- Clone a workflow job (whether it is running, finished, failed, or terminated), modify its parameters, and re-run it. *The cloned job can either be integrated into the workflow (forming a new workflow branch) or run separately in manual mode (as a one-off task).*
- Use the results from any workflow job for further development of the structure solution *Project*, regardless of whether the workflow has completed all steps. This can be done in parallel with the workflow execution.
