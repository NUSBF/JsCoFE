.. _tasklist:

The **Task List** in CCP4 Cloud presents all available tasks that can be executed for structure solution projects. It enables users to insert tasks into the *Job Tree*, configure inputs and parameters, and start jobs efficiently.

Task Organization
------------------
Tasks are categorized into several folders, each containing related tasks for streamlined navigation. Each task entry includes a button with an icon on the left and the task title on the right.

Folder Indicators
------------------
The folder name displays a number in brackets, representing the count of runnable tasks at the current point in the project. This point corresponds to the job selected in the **Job Tree**, located directly behind the **Task List**:

Task Availability
------------------
When you open a folder, tasks may be either runnable or unavailable:

- **Unavailable Tasks:**  
  Titles appear dimmed, and the task button is framed in **red**. These tasks cannot be run due to insufficient data at the current project point. Click the task button to view a detailed summary of the required and available data.

- **Runnable Tasks:**  
  Tasks are framed in either **green (no data ambiguity)** or **amber (data selection may be required before execution)**.  

Starting a Task
---------------
To execute a task:

1. Select a runnable task by clicking its button.  
2. The task will be added as a child of the highlighted node in the *Job Tree*.  
3. The *Job Dialog* will open, where you can:
   - Select input data.
   - Modify job parameters as needed.
   - Start the job by pressing the *"Run"* button in the *Job Dialog* toolbar.  

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage and execute tasks within your CCP4 Cloud project.
