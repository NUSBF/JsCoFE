.. _tasklist:

The Task List contains all tasks runnable in CCP4 Cloud and is used to select one
of them for insertion in the *Job Tree*, further configuration (choice of
input data and parameters), and starting a job.

All tasks are grouped into several folders. In each folder, relevant tasks are
listed as separate entries with a task button containing an icon on the left and the task
title on the right.

Each folder's name contains a number in brackets, showing how many tasks from
that folder can be run at a given point in CCP4 Cloud's Project. This point
corresponds to the selected job in the **Job Tree** right behind
the **Task List**:

If you open a folder of interest, you will see tasks that **cannot be run**,
presented with titles dimmed and the corresponding task button framed in **red**.
A task cannot be run if there is insufficient data for it at the given point
in the Project. You can see which data is missing by pressing the corresponding
task button -- a summary of the required and available data for the task will be shown.

If a task is runnable (with icons framed in either **green (no data ambiguity)** or
**amber (data may need to be selected before the run)**), then pressing the task
button will add it as a child of the highlighted node of the *Job Tree* and open
its *Job Dialog*. In the dialog, you may need to select input data, modify the job
parameters, and finally start the job by pressing the *"Run"* button in
the *Job Dialog's* toolbar.
