Work with diffraction images within CCP4 Cloud
==============================================

X-ray diffraction images have a considerable size, which makes uploading them to remote servers impractical. Due to bandwidth and disk space considerations, CCP4 Cloud does **NOT** allow users to upload raw files. 

Users may launch one of the `data processing tools (Xia-2, DUI, iMosflm, XDSGUI) <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/Data_Processing.html>`_ from CCP4 Cloud project as usual, and process data locally. The result will be sent to the CCP4 Cloud automatically after the task finishes. 

.. important::
             Launch CCP4 Cloud through the local installation of CCP4 on your computer |ccp4cloud_remote|.

`Xia-2 <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.Xia2.html>`_ task can be also run remotely when diffraction images are placed on Cloudâ€™s servers. Images can be placed on Cloud by respective CCP4 Cloud maintainers.
