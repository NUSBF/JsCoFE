About CCP4 Cloud
================

CCP4 Cloud is a computational resource and platform specifically designed for 
structural biology research. `CCP4 <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk>`_ stands for 
*"Collaborative Computational Project Number 4"* which is a longstanding 
project in the field of macromolecular crystallography. It provides software 
tools and resources for the determination of macromolecular structures by 
X-ray crystallography, and other biophysical techniques.

CCP4 Cloud extends the capabilities of the CCP4 software suite by providing 
a cloud-based platform where researchers can access computational resources 
for tasks such as X-ray data processing, phasing, model building, refinement,
validation, analysis, and preparation for `PDB <https://www.wwpdb.org/>`_ 
deposition. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure, CCP4 Cloud allows 
researchers to perform complex calculations without the need for significant 
local computational resources. This can be particularly beneficial for 
laboratories or institutions with limited computing infrastructure or for 
researchers who require on-demand access to scalable computing resources.

Accessing CCP4 Cloud
--------------------

Accessing CCP4 Cloud involves the following steps:

**Registration:** Visit the CCP4 Cloud website and register for an account 
if you haven't already. You will need to provide some basic information
(your name, chosen login name and e-mail address), indicate whether you are 
academic or commercial user, and choose one of feedback options.

**Login:** After registration, log in to your CCP4 Cloud account using your 
username and temporary password which you obtain in your mailbox.

**Usage:** Once logged in first time, choose new password in "My Account"
page. After that, you can access the CCP4 Cloud platform and its resources.
This involves uploading your data, running computational tasks using the 
available software tools, and accessing the results.

**Documentation and Support:** Familiarize yourself with the documentation 
and support resources provided by CCP4 Cloud. This includes user guides, 
tutorials, FAQs, and support channels where you can get assistance if needed.

**Licence:** Using CCP4 Cloud is covered by CCP4 Licence Agreement. CCP4 Licence
is free for academic users; commercial users must be covered by appropriate
licence agreement. Please find more details
`here <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/ccp4-licence-and-conditions-2/>`_.

CCP4 Cloud and CCP4 desktop applications
----------------------------------------

Selected CCP4 applications, such as **Coot**, **CCP4mg**, **DUI**, **iMosflm**, 
and some others, require CCP4 Software installed on your machine (see 
installation packages and instructions in 
`CCP4 Download <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/download/>`_). To use them in CCP4 Cloud, 
just start your Cloud session by clicking on one of CCP4 Cloud icons, found in 
CCP4 directory. To connect to remote CCP4 Cloud setup, click on:

.. image:: images/ccp4cloud_remote.png
      :scale: 8 %
      :align: center

In remote mode, your projects and data are kept on remote servers, and 
computational tasks run on cloud machines.

To start CCP4 Cloud locally on your machine, click on:

.. image:: images/ccp4cloud_desktop.png
      :scale: 8 %
      :align: center

In local mode, your projects and data are kept on your machine, and 
computational tasks run on your machine as well.

.. tip::
        Note that projects and data in your CCP4 Cloud account are not 
        synchronised with projects and data on your machine. You may,
        however, export projects from your account and import them into 
        CCP4 Cloud on your machine, and vice versa.
