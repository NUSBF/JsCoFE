About CCP4 Cloud
================

CCP4 Cloud is a cloud-based computational resource and platform designed specifically for structural biology research. `CCP4 <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk>`_ stands for *"Collaborative Computational Project Number 4"*, a long-established initiative in the field of macromolecular crystallography. It provides essential software tools and resources for determining macromolecular structures through X-ray crystallography and other biophysical techniques.

CCP4 Cloud builds on the CCP4 software suite by offering a cloud-based platform where researchers can access powerful computational resources for tasks such as X-ray data processing, phasing, model building, refinement, validation, analysis, and preparation for `PDB <https://www.wwpdb.org/>`_ deposition. By harnessing the power of cloud computing infrastructure, CCP4 Cloud enables researchers to perform complex calculations without the need for extensive local computational resources. This is particularly advantageous for laboratories or institutions with limited computing infrastructure, or for researchers who need on-demand access to scalable computing power.

Accessing CCP4 Cloud
--------------------

To access CCP4 Cloud, follow these steps:

**Registration:** Visit the CCP4 Cloud website and register for an account if you haven't done so already. You will be asked to provide basic information, including your name, chosen login name, and email address. Additionally, you will need to specify whether you are an academic or commercial user and select one of the available feedback options.

**Login:** After registration, log in to your CCP4 Cloud account using the username and temporary password sent to your email.

**Usage:** Upon your first login, you will be prompted to choose a new password on the "My Account" page. Afterward, you will have full access to the CCP4 Cloud platform and its resources. This includes uploading your data, running computational tasks using the available software tools, and reviewing the results.

**Documentation and Support:** Familiarize yourself with the available documentation and support resources. These include user guides, tutorials, FAQs, and various support channels where you can receive assistance if needed.

**Licence:** Use of CCP4 Cloud is governed by the CCP4 Licence Agreement. The CCP4 Licence is free for academic users, while commercial users must obtain an appropriate licence. For more details, refer to the licence agreement `here <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/ccp4-licence-and-conditions-2/>`_.

CCP4 Cloud and CCP4 Desktop Applications
----------------------------------------

Some CCP4 applications, such as **Coot**, **CCP4mg**, **DUI**, **iMosflm**, and others, require the CCP4 software to be installed on your local machine (see installation packages and instructions in `CCP4 Download <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/download/>`_). To use these applications within CCP4 Cloud, simply start your Cloud session by clicking on the relevant CCP4 Cloud icon in the CCP4 directory. To connect to the remote CCP4 Cloud setup, click on:

.. image:: images/ccp4cloud_remote.png
      :scale: 8 %
      :align: center

In remote mode, your projects and data are stored on remote servers, with computational tasks running on cloud machines.

To use CCP4 Cloud locally on your machine, click on:

.. image:: images/ccp4cloud_desktop.png
      :scale: 8 %
      :align: center

In local mode, your projects and data are stored on your machine, and computational tasks are performed locally.

.. tip::
        Note that projects and data stored in your CCP4 Cloud account are not automatically synchronised with projects and data on your local machine. However, you can export projects from your account and import them into CCP4 Cloud on your local machine, or vice versa.
