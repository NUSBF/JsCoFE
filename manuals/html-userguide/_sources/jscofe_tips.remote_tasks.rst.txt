Running Tasks Remotely in CCP4 Cloud Local
==========================================

By default, CCP4 Cloud Local stores all data and projects on your local computer
and runs tasks locally. However, in certain cases, you may wish to run specific 
tasks remotely on the CCP4 Cloud server. This is particularly useful for:

- Tasks that rely on third-party software not typically installed locally 
  (e.g., *AlphaFold-2*)
- Tasks that require access to large databases (e.g., *PDB*, *Gesamt archive*)
- Tasks that demand substantial computational resources (e.g., 
  *automated structure solvers*)

Remote task execution in CCP4 Cloud Local is seamless: all required data 
transfers occur automatically without user intervention.

To enable remote task execution:

1. Ensure you have a valid user account on the CCP4 Cloud server.
2. In the **CCP4 Cloud Configuration Utility**, check the box labeled 
   **"Allow for remote jobs in local mode."**
3. Enter your CCP4 Cloud login credentials (username and password) in the 
   **CCP4 Cloud Local Settings**.

Once configured, eligible tasks will display a cloud icon in the Task List.

.. note::

   You may need to **restart CCP4 Cloud** after updating your credentials for 
   the changes to take effect.

Clicking the cloud icon opens a drop-down menu with options **"Run remotely"** 
or **"Run locally"**, depending on the task's current run mode. When set to 
run remotely, the icon turns blue. Simply add the task to your project and 
run it as usual. This setting persists until manually changed.

.. note::

   The cloud icon also appears in the Taskâ€™s Job dialog, to the left of the 
   **Run** button. You can toggle the execution mode there before starting 
   the task. Once the task has started, the icon reflects where the given task 
   is actually being run and cannot be changed.

When remote execution is enabled, CCP4 Cloud Local checks the availability of 
the external server during startup. If the server is unreachable, the remote 
execution feature will be disabled automatically and a warning message will be 
shown. This check may introduce a slight delay during startup.
