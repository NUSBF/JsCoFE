=======================================
What are *XYZ*, *Model* and *Ensemble*?
=======================================

*XYZ*, *Model* and *Ensemble* are related, but not identical, types of data in
CCP4 Cloud. *XYZ* is a simple type, representing bare atomic coordinates, commonly
obtained from a PDB or mmCIF-formatted files. *Model* is a complex type used to
represent search models for Molecular Replacement (MR). It includes XYZ coordinates
of one or more macromolecular chains linked to target sequence(s) that these chains 
relate to, alomng with the corresponding similarity scores, such as sequence 
identity and estimated r.m.s.d.. *Ensemble* is another complex data type used 
in MR tasks, which represents sets of closely related *Models*, superposed on each 
other.

    *Models* and *Ensembles* can be used in *Phaser-MR* and *Molrep* tasks,
    while *XYZs* cannot be.

*Models* and *Ensembles* are prepared from *XYZ* and/or *Sequence* data with the help
of the following tasks, found in the "Molecualr Replacement" section of the *Task List*:

    * Find and Prepare MR Models with MrParse
    * Prepare MR Model(s) from Coordinate data
    * Prepare MR MOdel(s) from Alighnment data
    * Prepare MR Ensemble from Model(s)
    * Prepare MR Ensemble from Sequence 
    * Prepare MR Ensemble from Coordinate data 
    * Prepare MR Ensemble with CCP4mg

**Why XYZ data cannot be used in Molecular Replacement tasks directly?**

The main reason for disallowing the direct use of *XYZ* (*i.e.,* bare PDB or mmCIF files)
in CCP4 Cloud's MR tasks is to make the model preparation step mandatory and unavoidable.
This procedure includes trimming XYZ data for achieving best similarity with the target
sequence and should be always done before using coordinate data in MR tasks. This may seem
to be redundant and even annoying in some cases, but in general, prparatory step
significantly improves chances for successful Molecular Replacement.
