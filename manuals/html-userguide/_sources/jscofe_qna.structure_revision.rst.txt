What is *Structure Revision*?
=============================

**Structure Revision** may be viewed as a box, where CCP4 Cloud keeps various data items corresponding to particular stages of the structure solution project. The minimal **Structure Revision contains a reflection dataset (HKL), and description of asymmetric unit (ASU).** Usually, the minimal Structure Revision is created by the `ASU Content Definition Task <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.ASUDef.html>`_, which starts the phasing stage of structure solution. As the structure solution project develops, **Structure Revision** is passed from one task to another, getting updated with new or improved data (such as atomic coordinates, phases, ligands), until the structure is considered solved. The final **Structure Revision** is passed to the `PDB Deposition task <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.Deposition.html>`_, which generates files necessary for the deposition of solved structure in the `Protein Data Bank <https://www.rcsb.org/>`_ and acquires provisional `PDB Validation Report <https://www.wwpdb.org/validation/validation-reports/>`_.

------------------------------------------------------------------
*Structure Revision*'s scope of visibility and Project development
------------------------------------------------------------------

As a general rule, **"Structure Revision", produced by a task, shields all revisions produced by that task's parents**. Therefore, if a particular **Structure Revision** should be used in more than one task, the Project *must* branch at that point; this means that several tasks get appended as children to the task where that **Structure Revision** was produced. The only exception from this rule is given by data import tasks, which do not obscure revisions visible to them.

CCP4 Cloud tasks can accept only one **Structure Revision** on input, and most of them produce a single **Structure Revision** on output. Therefore, only one **Structure Revision** appears as an input choice in most cases. A few tasks can produce several **Structure Revisions**: `MAD phasing with Crank-2 <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.Crank2.html>`_, `Experimental Phasing with Phaser-EP <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.Phaser.html>`_ and `Model Building with CCP4Build <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.CCP4Build.html>`_. Any task, which follows these, will have a choice of **Structure Revisions** on input, and the user should exercise attention in these cases.

*Structure Revision* naming
---------------------------

**Structure Revisions** are named as in the following example:  ``R0258.01: refmac (protein)/xyz,phases``

where ``R`` stands for "Revision", ``0258`` is the serial number of the job, which produced the revision, ``01`` is the serial number of output revision in that job, ``refmac`` is the task name of the job (either generic or user-provided), and the rest is a variable list of descriptors. In the above example, the revision describes a crystal with protein content, for which some atomic coordinates and phases are calculated. If ``xyz`` prepends ``phases``, then the latter was calculated using the former (e.g., as in molecular replacement); otherwise, phases were obtained in course of Experimental Phasing or imported in the project, and atomic coordinates were ontained by building model in the corresponding electron density.

*Structure Revision* content inspection
---------------------------------------

The content of **Structure Revision** may be inspected in both input and output pages. In input pages, use the button with **magnifying glass** on the left from the **Structure Revision selection widget**. In output pages, use **Inspect** button on the left from the revision specification.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between *Structure* and *Structure Revision*?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In CCP4 Cloud, **Structure** provides description of crystal structure (defined as a combination of atomic coordinates, phases, and electron density), and **Structure Revision** represents the state of the structure solution project in terms of data, both experimental and generated along the given branch of the project. **"Structure Revision" includes "Structure" as one of its items.** Effectively, **Structure Revision** is a check-point in the structure solution project, which can be used for branching on a range of parameters or structure solution approaches/scenarios.
