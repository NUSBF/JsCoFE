CCP4 Cloud Archive
==================

CCP4 Cloud projects can be archived for long-term storage, free access and 
making external references. This article describes the archiving procedure and
working with archived projects. 

.. note::
  Functionality, described in this article, requires appropriate
  CCP4 Cloud configuration.


---------------------------------
General description and use cases
---------------------------------

CCP4 Cloud archive is a collection of projects referenced by stable identifiers,
Archive IDs. Upon archiving, the project is moved to a designated area in CCP4 Cloud 
storage, and the corresponding disk quota is released for the project owner. Archived
projects are frozen in their state at the time of archiving; no jobs can be deleted
from them. `However, new jobs and project branches can be added and the project author
can archive thus revised projects under the same Archive ID. <#revising-projects-in-ccp4-cloud-archive>`__


The main purpose of project archiving is to provide supplementary information
for scientific publications and other reports, where structure solution may be 
demonstrated by quoting the corresponding Archive ID. Projects may also be archived for sharing structure solution experience and practices, especially in difficult cases, and for general education purposes. In institutional or laboratory setups, CCP4 Cloud archives may be used for organising work results 
and preserving data and the history of extended structural studies.

Any CCP4 Cloud user can access archived projects in read-only mode with Archive ID.


----------------
Before archiving
----------------

Archiving a structure solution project is similar to publishing an article. Once
published, reversing is difficult. Therefore, take a little time to go through
the following checklist.

#. Make sure you have a case for archiving. In general, your project must be
   finished. Do not archive random trials, exercises, tutorials or intermediate
   results. A good example of a finished project is one that resulted in PDB
   deposition and obtaining a PDB code for your structure.

#. Follow general rules, accepted for publishing in your organisation. If you 
   have collaborators on the project, inform them of intended archiving and acquire
   their consent. If you are not the PI, consider whether the principal decision on
   archiving should be taken by your PI.

#. Prepare your project for archiving:

        *It's advisable to clone your project and do all the manipulation needed on its copy*

    - Make sure that your **project does not contain running jobs**. Either wait 
      for all jobs to finish or terminate and remove them from the project

    - **Unshare the project** with your collaborators in order to exclude accidental
      start of new jobs

    - **Remove jobs and project branches that do not relate to the final result**
      and do not add clarity about how the structure was solved. In most cases,
      you may leave only one branch starting from the project root and ending with the
      deposition task, the results of which were used for PDB deposition. 

    - Add remarks in unobvious places and edit job titles to help others understand
      your project by other people. As a general rule, the project should look
      like a story about solving your structure. **Remember, you will not be able
      to change anything in your project once archived**.

#. **Choose a suitable Archive ID**, which may include capital numbers, digits and
   periods and be no longer than 8 characters. If you have deposited your
   structure to the PDB, **the PDB code could be the best choice**. Another good
   alternative may be the **UniProt accession code** for the crystallised sequence.
   Beware that chosen Archive ID may be already taken, so think of alternatives.
   **If you do not specify the Archive ID at the time of archiving, a random one will be 
   generated.**

#. Prepare annotation data:

    - **list of your collaborators** (names and, if appropriate, e-mail addresses).
      Remember, you are responsible for paying due credit to everybody who made
      a contribution to your project

    - **list of related PDB or UniProt codes**, so that your project could appear in 
      context searches

    - **list of related publications** (only DOIs are required)

    - **list of suitable keywords** for archive searches


-------------------
Archiving procedure
-------------------

.. note::
  Projects can be archived only by their owners, who originally created them,
  from folders in **My Projects** area 

The archiving procedure may be started in one of the following ways:

- by moving project into **Projects archived by me** folder

- by moving project into **CCP4 Cloud Archive** folder

- by right-clicking on project line in **Project List** and choosing **Archive**
  from the drop-down menu.

Any of these actions will produce a dialogue window with detailed instructions.
After setting all necessary data, push the **Archive** button, which starts the
archiving procedure. 

.. note::  During archiving, no operations with the project are permitted, for which you will be logged out and your account suspended. Wait for the procedure to finish (approximately a minute per gigabyte of the project's data), and log in again. 

Your archived project is now in the **Projects archived by me** folder.


----------------------------------------
Accessing projects in CCP4 Cloud Archive
----------------------------------------

Projects, archived by you, are listed in the **Projects archived by me** folder.
They cannot be removed.

In order to access projects archived by others, change to the **CCP4 Cloud Archive** folder, press the **Access** button and follow the instructions in the archive access dialogue. Requested projects will be listed in the same folder, and can be delisted when necessary.

Archived projects can be opened and viewed as any other projects in CCP4 Cloud. However, they are locked so that they cannot be changed by non-owners. 

Project owners can revise archived projects as described below.


---------------------------------------
Revising projects in CCP4 Cloud Archive
---------------------------------------

Archived projects are supposed to be found in their original state "forever", 
in order to correspond to the content of associated PDB entry or published
article/report. In exceptional cases, PDB entries may be revised; likewise,
published studies may be amended or even withdrawn. Therefore, archived projects 
may also require revision **in exceptional cases**.

Archived projects may be revised by cloning them, making necessary changes 
in the clone and re-archiving. This can be done an unlimited number of times,
and doing this does not affect your archive quota. The following points should 
be taken into account:

- **No jobs can be deleted from what was previously archived**, and only new
  jobs can be added

- Whenever a new branch is started in the previously archived project, it is 
  automatically annotated with a revision number. Revision counter advances 
  automatically when the project is archived

- Re-archiving does not allow for changing the Archive ID

- Archived projects can be cloned and extended by any user, but only project
  the owner can re-archive them.

.. note::
  Cloned projects retain ownership information.
