Introducing Moorhen (aka web-Coot)
==================================

Most crystallographers are familiar with **Coot** - an essential tool for 
building and refining macromolecular structures. While Coot is available 
through **CCP4 Cloud**, you may notice that Coot tasks appear *deactivated* 
when accessing CCP4 Cloud directly via a web browser. This is because Coot 
needs to run within a locally configured CCP4 environment, which browsers 
cannot launch on their own.

However, CCP4 Cloud has a workaround: you can still use Coot if you access 
CCP4 Cloud via the ``ccp4cloud-remote`` or ``ccp4cloud-local`` launchers 
placed by the **CCP4 Setup Manager** on your computer's desktop. These 
launchers are also available as scripts in the CCP4 ``bin`` folder.

Enter **Moorhen** - a modern, browser-native counterpart to Coot, developed 
specifically for use in web browsers. Moorhen incorporates Coot's core 
codebase but presents it through a web-friendly interface, eliminating the 
need for special connections or local installations. Find Moorhen in the 
same section of the CCP4 Cloud Task List where the Coot tasks are located.

Moorhen includes nearly all the core functionality of Coot needed for model 
building and refinement, and we're continuously working to bring it to full 
feature parity. It is **seamlessly integrated** with CCP4 Cloud - you can 
run it like any other task, and your results will be saved automatically 
to your project when you exit.

In the unlikely event of a crash, simply **clone the task** and use the 
**recovery function** (see Moorhen's documentation) to restore your work.

Give Moorhen a try - you might find that it becomes your tool of choice. 
With Moorhen, structure solution can happen entirely online.
