Custom (user-created) project workflows
=======================================

CCP4 Cloud projects can be developed automatically, using one of pre-defined
:ref:`automatic workflows <workflows_guide>`, as well as *custom workflows*,
defined by user.

.. _custom_workflows_use:

--------------------------------------------------
What are custom workflows and how one can use them
--------------------------------------------------

Custom workflow is a script (*WScript*) describing tasks that need to be 
performed and the order of their invocation, *i.e.*, the workflow algorithm.
The script is placed in a plain text file with extension ``.wscript``,
which can be created by most text editors, such as *vim*, *nano*, *notepad*
(Windows), *TextEdit* (Mac) and similar. Make sure that you save file as
"plain text" when using advanced editors such as *MS Word*, *Libre Office*
(not recommended).

Custom workflow can be started in one of 3 ways:

* Import ``.wscript`` file with other needed files, such as ``.mtz``
  (reflections, phases), ``.pdb``, ``.mmcif`` (structure models),
  ``.cif`` (ligand descriptions), ``.lib`` (restraint libraries),
  ``.seq``, in a *single* import task. After importing, the task will
  start workflow automatically if *WScript* is correct and all necessary 
  data files are provided 

* Add ``.wscript`` files to the set of data files in
  :ref:`CloudRun command file <cloudrun>` (use generic :ref:`FILE <cloudrun_FILE>`
  keyword), choose :ref:`import <cloudrun_TASK>` task and execute the
  ``CloudRun`` utility. All file will be uploaded to CCP4 Cloud, project
  created and workflow started automatically

* Add *WScript* to the *My Workflows* list in the *Workflows* tab of the
  *Task List*, after which it can be used as any other task in the
  system.


-------------------------------------
Writing the Workflow script (WScript)
-------------------------------------

The main idea behind workflows is to automate operations when the same project (or branch of a project) needs to be repeated many (100s) times with  different input data, and **WScript** is limited to that purpose.

The easiest way to create a **WScript** file is through using **Workflow Creator** in CCP4 Cloud. Login in your account and open **Task List** in any project.
Then open tab **Workflows**, scroll it to section **My Workflows** in the end and push button **Add workflow**. This will launch **Workflow Creator** window with a template script loaded. It makes a good sense to save the newly created workflow in your personal library, therefore give it a unique *Workflow ID* on top of the dialog window. For easier workflow identification in **My Workflows** library, you may also change the colour of the workflow icon – simply click on it and choose from available options. Now you can save the script – it will appear in the **My Workflows** section of the **Task List**. You can run it as any other task now, but doing so will result in an empty **Job Dialog**, because we only saved a template, which does nothing.

Let's give it a useful content now. Click on **Edit** button on the right from  the just created workflow in **My Workflows**, this opens **Workflow Creator** again, with the previous content looking something like this: ::

In **WScript** lines, everything on the right from the hash "#" sign is a comment and may be safely deleted. Perhaps you may want to delete first few lines from the template, but in general, the more comments you make in the script, the more 
understandable and maintainable it is. You can use spaces to your aesthetic 
preferences; where there must be a space separator, any number of spaces can be
used. 

**WScript** is based on single-line statements, containing keywords and values.
Keywords, which normally start **WScript** statements, are case-insensitive.
Values, on contrary, should be specified with respect to upper/lower case. Full
list of keywords is given in the end of this document.

We will create new workflow in several steps now.

.. _simple_mr_workflow:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Simple MR Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As first example, let's write a simple workflow, which takes reflection data,
structure template, sequence and solves structure with Molecular Replacement
using Molrep.

Firstly, remove unnecessary lines and put a reasonable annotation in the
header section of the **WScript** file, so that it starts with this
workflow header: ::

    #
    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # Molecular Replacement with Molrep
    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # Sun Dec 31 2023
    #

    VERSION  1.0    # script version for backward compatibility
    DEBUG    OFF    # ON/OFF
    COMMENTS ON     # ON/OFF

    # ==========================================================================
    # Workflow header

    # General workflow descriptors
    NAME     molrep workflow         # to show in Job Tree
    ONAME    mrp_wflow               # to use for naming output files
    TITLE    Molrep-based Workflow   # to display in Task List
    DESC     takes HKL, XYZ and SEQ and solves structure with Molrep
    ICON     Maraschino              # (optional) workflow icon colour
    KEYWORDS molrep workflow         # for using in A-Z keyword search

    ALLOW_UPLOAD       # create file upload widgets if started from project root

You may save the workflow now and check how its description changed in
**My Workflows** list. Re-open it again by pushing the relevant **Edit** button.

Secondly, specify data, which workflow will use, in **WScript**'s' input data
section (just append these statements to the script): ::

    # ==========================================================================
    # Input data section. List all data required, "!" specifies mandatory items.

    !DATA HKL
    !DATA XYZ  TYPES protein
    !DATA SEQ  TYPES protein

These statements mean that the workflow requires 3 mandatory items: reflection 
data (HKL), search model (XYZ, must be protein chain(s)) and sequence (SEQ, 
also of aminoacid type). In order to understand what these statements do, save 
the script and create a new task with it from the root of your project – you
should see input fields for data files. To check further, run Cloud's 
**File Import** task and import all needed files, then append your workflow as
the next task – you should see selectors for imported data. You can even run 
the workflows now; it will fail immediately though because we did not specify 
any tasks in the **WScript** file yet.

We now want to make a sequence of at least 5 tasks:

- prepare MR model
- define ASU
- run Molrep
- re-build model with, e.g., Buccaneer
- refine with Refmac

Re-open molrep workflow script in **Workflow Cretor** again. In the bottom of 
the dialog window, click button **Add task** and select *"Model Preparation XYZ"*
in the combobox found in the header. This populates the dialog window with
default task options like in original task interfaces. Choose options that you
want to change, set their values, and push **Add to workflow** button. This
will append the following construct: ::

    @MODELPREPXYZ
        RUN ModelPrepXYZ

to the end of the script if you did not change anything in task parameters.
If a non-default parameter value were chosen, *e.g.*, if you changed
*"Modification protocol"* for *"PDB Clip"*, then the construct would
look slightly different: ::

    @MODELPREPXYZ
        PARAMETER MODIFICATION_SEL D  # Modification protocol
        RUN ModelPrepXYZ

These examples give an idea of how CCP4 Cloud tasks are described in custom 
workflows. Each task is represented by a block of lines, which starts with
*RUN NAME* and finishes with *RUN* statement. *RUN NAME* must be a unique
alphanumeric identifier starting with *"@"* symbol. Other lines between
*RUN NAME* and *RUN* statements may contain values for task parameters,
and only non-default parameters should be specified for brevity. See more
details in the :ref:`wscript_reference` below.

Similarly to the *"Model Preparation XYZ"* task, you can now add 
*"ASU Definition"*, *"Molrep"*, *"Buccaneer"* and *"Refmac"* tasks to the
workflow, in that order. The resulting **WScript** will look like
the following: ::

    #
    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # Molecular Replacement with Molrep
    # -----------------------------------------------------

    DESC     takes HKL, XYZ and SEQ and solves structure with Molrep
    ICON     Maraschino              # (optional) workflow icon colour

    @MODELPREPXYZ
        RUN ModelPrepXYZ
    #

    @ASUDEF
        RUN ASUDef
    #

    @MOLREP
        RUN Molrep
    #

    @BUCCANEER
        RUN Buccaneer
    #

    @REFMAC
        RUN Refmac
    #

This makes a completely functional workflow, which you can run now by any of
the three methods described in :ref:`custom_workflows_use` (you need to
copy-paste **WScript** from **Workflow Creator** into external file with 
``.wscript`` extension for using it with the **Import** task or **CloudRun**
utility).

.. note::
   Unlike in manually-developed CCP4 Cloud projects, where a user cannot
   create a task if there is no suitable data for it, workflows do not
   check or control that task order is correct from the data flow point of 
   view. Therefore, you should have a good understanding of task order
   suitable for your purposes, or, better, take it from a manually developed
   project representing your workflow in design.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Conditional statements and other advanced operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the moment, our molrep workflow is quite straightforward in respect to its 
input data and algorithm. We may wish to make it more flexible. For example, it would be good if you can take both merged and unmerged reflection data on input, optimize refinement parameters and, optionally, prepare file for PDB deposition from the best results achieved.

**Conditions based on availability of data**

Let's start from optional unmerged reflections input. We can instruct the
workflow to accept both merged and unmerged reflections by modifying the
corresponding ``DATA`` statement as below: ::

    !DATA HKL UNMERGED
    !DATA XYZ  TYPES protein
    !DATA SEQ  TYPES protein

Now we need scale and merge unmerged reflections with *"Aimless"* task, which
should be run before merged reflections are used, *i.e.*, before 
*"ASU Definition"* or even *"Model Preparation XYZ"*. To do that, open
workflow's **WScript** in **Workflow Creator**, place cursor on line just
above the ``@MODELPREPXYZ`` line and push **Insert task** button, then select 
*"Aimless"* task in new window and push **Insert in workflow** button. This
should modify the beginning of workflow body as below: ::

    # ==========================================================================
    # Workflow run body

    @AIMLESS
        DATA      ds0  unmerged
        RUN Aimless
    #

    @MODELPREPXYZ
        RUN ModelPrepXYZ
    #

    @ASUDEF
        RUN ASUDef
    #

This fragment will work fine if workflow receives unmerged reflections on input. 
However, if, instead, already scaled and merged reflections are supplied,
the *"Aimless"* task will fail and workflow stop. In order to skip invocation
of *"Aimless"* task if no data is available, put ``IFDATA`` statement into
task's description: ::

    @AIMLESS
        IFDATA    unmerged
        DATA      ds0  unmerged
        RUN Aimless
    #

.. note::
   in ``IFDATA`` statement, ``unmerged`` must be in lower case.

Now, the workflow will work with both merged and unmerged reflection data. If a
task needs to be run when data *is not* available, use ``IFNOTDATA`` instead.
For example, an equivalent (but less obvious) solution could be ::

    @AIMLESS
        IFNOTDATA hkl
        DATA      ds0  unmerged
        RUN Aimless
    #

.. note::
   data names in ``IFDATA`` and ``IFNOTDATA`` statements are given by the
   lower-case versions of the corresponding data types used in ``DATA``
   statements, i.e., ``hkl``, ``unmerged``, ``xyz``, ``seq`` and so on.
   See :ref:`wscript_reference`  for details.

**Looping and Branching**

Sometimes, a task needs to be run with same data but varying parameters. In 
CCP4 Cloud terms, this is equivalent to cloning task with suitable modification
of parameter(s) of interest. For example, imagine that you wish to repeat
*"Refmac"* task with suggested parameters until no suggestions are generated or
number of runs exceeds a certain number (let's say, 5). The following fragment
gives an idea of how this may be programmed in **WScript**: ::

    # Initialise loop control parameters

    let iter   = 1     # iteration serial number
    let iter0  = 0     # iteration number of result with the lowest Rfree
    let Rfree0 = 1.0   # the lowest Rfree achieved

    @REFINE-OPT[iter]  # [iter] modifies the RUN NAME implicitly to make it unique
        USE_SUGGESTED_PARAMETERS   # use suggested parameters or defaults if none
        RUN       Refmac

    # capture iteration number with the lowest Rfree achieved
    let iter0 = iter; Rfree0 = Rfree  if  Rfree<Rfree0
    let iter  = iter + 1

    # keep iterating if conditions are met and pass otherwise
    repeat @REFINE-OPT while suggested>0 and iter<5 

    # continue further down from iteration with the lowest Rfree
    branch @REFINE-OPT[iter0]

In this fragment, workflow allocates 3 variables ``iter``, ``iter0`` and
``Rfree0`` and uses predefined variables ``Rfree`` (achieved *R_free*) and
``suggested`` (the number of suggested changes to *Refmac* parameters).
You may replace ``@REFMAC`` run construct with this entire fragment in our
molrep workflow and re-run it to see the result.

The ``branch`` statement specifies results from which particular task will be 
taken for further processing. In this example, results with lowest *R_free*
will be chosen. To see this, append another task, such as 
*"PDB Validation Report"* to the workflow and re-run it.


**Workflow parameters**

Suppose now that we want to introduce workflow parameters, which a user could manipulate as in any other task. For example, let the user set a resolution cut-off in **Aimless** and decide whether to run the **Buccaneer** task. For this, add input of real-number parameter and a checkbox in
:ref:`wscript_reference_input_parameters`: ::

    # ==========================================================================
    # Workflow parameters section. List all parameters required, "!" specifies
    # mandatory items.

    PAR_REAL      resHigh   # variable name to be used in workflow's expressions
        LABEL     High resolution cut-off (&Aring;)
        TOOLTIP   High resolution cut-off, angstrom
        IWIDTH    40        # input field width is set to 40 pixels
        RANGE     0.1 5.0   # allowed min/max values
        DEFAULT   1.5       # default value

    PAR_CHECK     runBuccaneer # variable name to be used in workflow's expressions
        LABEL     Re-build model
        TOOLTIP   Check if phased model should be re-built
        DEFAULT   Checked

Save **WScript**, create a new molrep workflow task and check how graphical
widgets for parameters look like.

When workflow is started, it assigns input parameters (either given by user or
read from *DEFAULT* fields) to internal variables specified in *PAR_XXX* 
statements. In the above example, two variables: *resHigh* and *runBuccaneer*
will be created for high-resolution cutoff (real) and flag for running
*Buccaneer* (boolean *True/False*), respectively. In order to use these flags,
remove *Aimless* task from the workflow and re-insert it in the same place
with **Workflow Creator**. When selecting *Aimless* in the task menu, specify
a non-default value for the high-resolution cut-off, for example, 1.4A. This
will give code fragment as follows: ::

    @AIMLESS
        DATA      ds0  unmerged
        PARAMETER RESO_HIGH 1.4  # high resolution cut-off (&Aring;)
        RUN Aimless

Now specify place the internal variable from the resolution cut-off widget 
instead of "1.4" and restore the ``IFDATA`` statement: ::

    @AIMLESS
        IFDATA    unmerged
        DATA      ds0  unmerged
        PARAMETER RESO_HIGH resHigh  # high resolution cut-off (&Aring;)
        RUN Aimless
    #

.. note::
   Where a variable is used, any function can be used as well. For example,
   one can put ``2*resHigh``, ``max(1.5,resHigh)`` and similar expressions 
   instead of ``resHigh`` in the above **WScript** fragment.

As for the *Buccaneer*, we need simply to indicate that the task should be
run if ``runBuccaneer`` is ``True``: ::

    @BUCCANEER
        IF runBuccaneer
        RUN Buccaneer

The final **WScript** for our molrep workflow reads as follows: ::

-----------------------
Custom Workflow Library
-----------------------

CCP4 Cloud comes with a library of custom workflows, which give **WScript** 
examples for few typical scenarios. They can be also used as templates for
your own developments. Just open **Workflow Creator**, push **Library**
button and select a suitable **WScript**. It can be further modified to your
needs as any text file.


.. _wscript_reference:

-----------------
WScript Reference
-----------------

**WScript** file consists of four **sections**, which must follow order presented
in this Reference. Each section contains a specific set of **WScript** 
statements; no statement from one section can appear in another one. Section 
separators are not used; **WScript** recognises sections automatically. Only
:ref:`wscript_reference_input_parameters` can be empty.

All **WScript** **statements** occupy a single line. Statements start with a 
case-insensitive primary key, which may be followed by additional case-insensitive
key(s) and values. Any number of consecutive spaces is equivalent to one space,
except when these spaces occur in string-type values. Part of line starting
from hash sign "#" is considered as a comment and is ignored; empty lines are
ignored, too.

Some **WScript** constructs are made of several statements, which must be
placed on consecutive lines (comments and empty lines ignored). Such constructs
have mandatory leading and trailing statements, other statements can be placed
in arbitrary order.

**WScript** supports pre-defined and user-defined variables, which can hold
real, integer, boolean and string values. String literals must be double-quoted
(*e.g.*, "this is a string literal"), boolean literals are case-sensitive
``True`` and ``False``. Pre-defined variables get their values from completed
tasks; see details in :ref:`wscript_reference_predefined_variables`.

Wherever variable's value is used, any in-line expression can be placed instead,
which may also include other variables; reference to variable's value should be
viewed as a computable trivial expression made of a single variable. See
available functions, constants and operators in
:ref:`wscript_reference_expression_syntax`.

       as one input data type).


.. _wscript_reference_input_data:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Input data section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Input data section must follow :ref:`wscript_reference_header` and cannot 
be empty. The section may contain only ``DATA`` and ``!DATA`` statements, where
exclamation mark means that data input is mandatory. One ``DATA`` statement
creates a single graphical widget, which can take specified data objects. The
statement has the following syntax: ::

    DATA object(s) [TYPES subtype(s)]

where the ``TYPES`` part is optional.

.. _wscript_reference_input_parameters:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Input parameters section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Input parameters section is optional. If used, it must follow
:ref:`wscript_reference_input_data`. The section is made of principal
statements ``PAR_*`` or ``!PAR_*`` followed by their specifications. The leading 
exclamation mark means that user's input is mandatory and the corresponding
parameter cannot have a default value. On contrary, ``PAR_*`` statements must 
have a default parameter specified. The exclamation mark cannot be applied in
case of ``PAR_CHECK`` and ``PAR_COMBO`` parameters, which always have a
default value.

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Key
     - Value
     - Description
   * - PAR_INTEGER

       to internal workflow variable with specified name, which is created
       automatically.
   * - PAR_REAL
     - variable's name
     - Creates graphical widget for real number input. The input is assigned to
       internal workflow variable with specified name, which is created
       automatically.
   * - PAR_STRING
     - variable's name

       PAR_CHECK cannot be preceded with the exclamation sign, and it always 
       has a default value (unchecked if not specified).
   * - PAR_COMBO
     - variable's name
     - Creates graphical widget for combobox input. The input (value associated
       with the selected combobox item) is assigned to internal workflow variable
       with specified name, which is created automatically. PAR_COMBO cannot be
       preceded with the exclamation sign, and it always has a default value

     - Selection item for ``PAR_COMBO`` widget. Statement's value consists of a 
       key and text string, which is displayed as a selectable string in the
       combobox. If string is selected by user, widget's variable is assigned
       the corresponding key. For example, ``OPTION A Choose option A`` will
       put line ``Choose option A`` in the combobox. If this line is selected,
       combobox's value is string ``"A"``.

.. _wscript_reference_workflow_body:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Workflow body section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Workflow body must be the last section in **WScript** file. It may contain
task run instructions, variables and workflow control statements.

Task run instructions represent a set of statements which starts with *Run Name*
statement and finishes with *Run* statenment: ::

    @RUN_NAME
        # ... other optional statements ...
        RUN  TaskName

The most convenient way of making run instruction is through using the 
**Workflow Creator**, as described in :ref:`simple_mr_workflow` with many
examples and explanations. Therefore, here only the reference of relevant 
statements is provided.

.. list-table:: Task run statements
   :widths: 8 18 74
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Key
     - Parameters
     - Description
   * - @RUN_NAME
     - None
     - Unique name, which opens the set of relevant statements and is used 
       for referencing task in looping and branching
   * - @RUN_NAME[x]
     - None
     - Same as ``@RUN_NAME`` but modified with the value of variable ``x``.
       Such modification is used in loops and branching, see examples in
       :ref:`simple_mr_workflow`.
   * - IF
     - expression
     - Instructs to run the task only if ``expression`` evaluates to ``True``,
       for example, ``IF  Rfree<0.4``.
   * - IFDATA
     - data type
     - Instructs to run the task only if data of specified type is present.
       data type should be given as a lowercase of data types used in ``DATA``
       statements in :ref:`wscript_reference_input_data`, for example,
       ``hkl``, ``unmerged``, ``xyz``, ``seq``, ``library``, ``ligand``.
   * - IFNOTDATA
     - data type
     - Instructs to run the task only if data of specified type is *NOT* present.
       data type should be given as a lowercase of data types used in ``DATA``
       statements in :ref:`wscript_reference_input_data`, for example,
       ``hkl``, ``unmerged``, ``xyz``, ``seq``, ``library``, ``ligand``.
   * - DATA
     - data id and data name
     - Forces placement of specified data in particular item of CCP4 Cloud task.
       This is necessary when task interface has "not standard" data id, or
       when task does not use Structure Revision that is already in the branch. 
       
       Example 1. *Aimless* task
       assumes input of merged or unmerged reflections for symmetry reference in
       data object with id ``ds0``. This id is not recognised automatically as a
       recipient of reflection data, therefore, statement ``DATA ds0 unmerged`` 
       or ``DATA ds0 hkl`` must be placed in task instructions for *Aimless*: ::

          @AIMLESS
              IFDATA    unmerged
              DATA      ds0  unmerged
              RUN Aimless

       Example 2. Sequence alignment task expects input of mixed objects, such
       as sequences and models, in a single field named ``seq``. The corresponding
       description is as follows: ::

          @SEQALIGN
              DATA seq seq
              DATA seq xyz
              RUN SeqAlign

       Example 3. Dimple-MR takes merged reflections and atomic coordinates 
       rather than Structure Revision: ::

          @DIMPLEMR
              DATA hkl hkl
              DATA xyz xyz
              RUN DimpleMR

   * - ALIAS
     - standard data id and task data id
     - Used in cases when data id, used in task interface, is not "standard",
       such as ``revision``, ``hkl``, ``seq``, ``xyz`` and similar. Example:
       ``ALIAS  revision istruct`` (for *XyzUtils*).
   * - USE
     - data name and number / variable / expression
     - Used for data object specification in cases when several data objects
       with given name are available. For example, *Crank-2* creates up to 4 
       *Structure Revisions* after MAD phasing, and the following statement:
       ``USE REVISION 2`` could be used in next task description in order to
       force using 2nd revision produced.
   * - PROPERTY
     - data name, property id and property value
     - Used for modifying properties of data objects. For example,
       ``PROPERTY HKL res_high 1.4`` request cutting reflection dataset to 
       1.4A in *Change Resolution* task; ``PROPERTY REVISION>HKL wtype "peak"``
       sets string value ``"peak"`` (not to be mistaken with ``peak`` variable,
       therefore, enquoted) for the wavelength type in *Crank-2* or *ShelxCD*. 
   * - PARAMETER
     - parameter id and value (expression)
     - Assigns the specified value (or result of specified expression) to
       task parameter with specified id. Parameters ids coincide with keys in
       "parameters" structure of the corrsponding task class. Example:
       ``PARAMETER VDW_VAL 2.0`` (for *Refmac*).
   * - USE_SUGGESTED_PARAMETERS
     - none
     - Forces using parameters suggested based on results of previous task of
       the same types. Currently, this is applicable only to *Refmac*.
   * - RUN
     - Task name
     - Gives the name of CCP4 Cloud task that must be run, and finishes the set
       of task run statements.


.. list-table:: Workflow variables and control
   :widths: 8 92
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - let x = *expression* [if *condition*]
     - Variable assignment, for example: ::

           let x = 1

       Several assignments can be placed in a single statement: ::

           let x = 1; y = sin(PI/4); z = x+y

       The whole statement may be made conditional: ::

           let x = 1; y = sin(PI/4); z = x+y if Rfree<0.3

   * - repeat @RUN_NAME while *condition*
     - Instruction to repeat the specified task while *condition* evaluates to
       *True*, for example: ::

           repeat @REFINEMENT while Rfree>0.4 and iter<10

       .. note::
          Task, used in ``repeat`` statement, should be described with modificator,
          *e.g.*, ``@REFINEMENT[iter]``, and modificator should be advanced
          within the repeat loop scope, *e.g.*, ``let iter = iter + 1``. Always
          limit the maximum number of repeats (10 in the above example) to avoid 
          infinite looping. Note that ``@RUN_NAME`` is specified without 
          modificator in ``repeat`` statement.

   * - branch @RUN_NAME [if *condition*]
     - Instruction to continue next task from the specified task, for example: ::

           branch @MODEL_BUILDING-1

       If task was described with modificator, it *must be* explicitly specified
       as a variable with correct value: ::  

           branch @DENSITY_MODIFICATION[hand0]

       Branching may be subject to *condition*, evaluated to *True*::

           branch @MODEL_BUILDING-2 if Rfree>0.4

   * - continue @RUN_NAME [if *condition*]
     - Instruction to continue the workflow from the specified task, for example: ::

           continue @REFINEMENT

       continuation may be subject to *condition*, evaluated to *True*::

           continue @REFINEMENT if Rfree>0.4

   * - POINT @RUN_NAME
     - Marks point in the workflow which can be used in ``continue`` (and only 
       in ``continue``). There are no actions associated with this operator.

   * - PARALLEL ON|OFF
     - Tasks found between ``PARALLEL ON`` and ``PARALLEL OFF`` statements will
       be executed in parallel. Each such task will start a new branch, and 
       statements after ``PARALLEL OFF`` will be applied in each branch. Therefore,
       parallel tasks should produce compatible output.

   * - PRINT_VAR
     - Prints current values of all workflow variables in CCP4 Cloud task's log
       file. example: ::

           PRINT_VAR  Rfactor

   * - checkTask(name)
     - Queries task availability and assignes ``True/False`` to variable
       ``name_available``, for example: ::

           checkTask(StructurePrediction)
           PRINT_VAR   StructurePrediction_available
           continue  @AUTO_MR if not StructurePrediction_available 

   * - STOP [if *condition*]
     - Stops the workflow. If condition is given, then workflow is stopped if
       *condition* evaluates ``True``, for example: ::

           STOP if Rfree<0.22

   * - END
     - Ends the workflow.

   * - Function
     - Description
   * - random(n)
     - Get a random number in the range [0, n]. If n is zero, or not provided, it defaults to 1.
   * - fac(n)
     - n! (factorial of n: "n * (n-1) * (n-2) * … * 2 * 1") Deprecated. Use the ! operator instead.
   * - min(a,b,…)
     - Get the smallest (minimum) number in the list.
   * - max(a,b,…)
     - Get the largest (maximum) number in the list.
   * - hypot(a,b)
     - Hypotenuse, i.e. the square root of the sum of squares of its arguments.
   * - pyt(a, b)
     - Alias for hypot.
   * - pow(x, y)
     - Equivalent to x^y. For consistency with JavaScript's Math object.
   * - atan2(y, x)
     - Arc tangent of x/y. i.e. the angle between (0, 0) and (x, y) in radians.
   * - roundTo(x, n)
     - Rounds x to n places after the decimal point.
   * - map(f, a)
     - Array map: Pass each element of `a` the function `f`, and return an array of the results.
   * - fold(f, y, a)
     - Array fold: Fold/reduce array `a` into a single value, `y` by setting `y = f(y, x, index)` for each element `x` of the array.
   * - filter(f, a)
     - Array filter: Return an array containing only the values from `a` where `f(x, index)` is `true`.
   * - indexOf(x, a)
     - Return the first index of string or array `a` matching the value `x`, or `-1` if not found.
   * - join(sep, a)
     - Concatenate the elements of `a`, separated by `sep`.
   * - if(c, a, b)
     - Function form of c ? a : b. Note: This always evaluates both `a` and `b`, regardless of whether `c` is `true` or not. Use `c ? a : b` instead if there are side effects, or if evaluating the branches could be expensive.
