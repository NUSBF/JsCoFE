.. note:: You can export |Export| projects from local installation and import |Import| them back to the CCP4 Cloud server once it is up again

.. warning:: Log in to |ccp4cloud_remote| CCP4 Cloud Remote and delete (or rename) all projects exported before.

To login go to https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/ or find the cloud icon in the Activities or Software menus (depending on the installed version of Linux) and click on the |ccp4cloud_remote| ccp4cloud-remote icon or type ``ccp4cloud-remote.sh`` in terminal

To **delete** your projects: select the project (left-click) in the list of projects and press the |delete| delete button. Do this with due care: once deleted, projects cannot be restored.
