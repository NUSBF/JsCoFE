<h1>What is <em>CFOM</em> in the SHELXD output?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-CFOM-shelxd" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>CFOM</em> reported by SHELXD is sum of two correlation coefficients: <em>CC+CC<sub>weak</sub></em> where
<em>CC</em> is correlation coefficient between the observed &Delta;F's and the F's calculated from the determined 
substructure model and <em>CC<sub>week</sub></em> is <em>CC</em> of the weaker reflections only.  Please consult 
<a href="http://shelx.uni-goettingen.de/">the SHELXD webpage</a> for more information.

<h1>What is <em>CC<sub>range</sub></em> in the PRASA output?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-CCrange-prasa" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>CC<sub>range</sub></em> reported by PRASA is an average of adjusted correlation coefficients between 
the observed &Delta;F's and the F's calculated from the determined substructure model at various resolution cutoffs.
The correlation coefficients at different cutoffs are not directly comparable but CC<sub>range</sub></em> allows
for a rough comparison of solutions obtained at different resolution cutoffs.

  <div class="section" id="what-is-subdet-threshold">
<h1>What does the threshold in substructure determination mean?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-subdet-threshold" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Substructure determination stops either by finishing the specified number of iterations or by reaching the 
specified score threshold (<em>CFOM</em>). The score threshold is automatically set rather conservatively to make 
sure that the procedure only stops preliminary if the score is quite convincing that the solution was found.

  <div class="section" id="what-is-FOM">
<h1>What is <em>FOM</em>?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-FOM" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Figure of merit (FOM) is an estimator of quality of the phases.  In CRANK2, it is calculated as mean value of
cosine of difference from the estimated phase &lt;cos(&Delta;&Phi;)&gt; by integrating the likelihood probability 
distribution over the entire range &lt;0,2&Pi;&gt;. <br>
Generally, the values of <em>FOM</em> close to 0 mean that the phases are close to random and values close to 1 mean 
a high confidence with the phases. The average <em>FOM</em> of reflections should improve during the structure solution and 
its value in earlier stages depend on the strength of the anomalous signal. <br>
For a SAD experiment, if the initial <em>FOM</em> right after substructure determination is larger than 0.3 then
the phases are likely good while less than 0.15 indicates weak phases or an incorrect substructure.  After CRANK2
performs the density modification with bias reduction, good phases are indicated by values of above 0.5 while very
weak or wrong phases by values below 0.35.  After model building and refinement, the <em>FOM</em> of a reasonable
model should be above 0.6.

  <div class="section" id="what-is-beta">
<h1>What is the <em>&beta;</em> parameter in density modification?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-beta" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Density modification is known to lead to highly biased (overstimated) figures of merit.  CRANK2 implements
a bias reduction method to suppres the bias and keep the figures of merit a sensible measure of quality of the
phases (the procedure often helps to slightly improve the quality of the maps from density modification as well).
The <em>&beta;</em> parameter is an estimator of the bias: values close to 1 estimate there is (almost) no bias 
and values below 0.5 mean a very large bias.  The <em>&beta;</em> parameter is applied to the covariance matrix
of the likelihood function that CRANK2 uses for phase combination in density modification. Please consult 
<a href="https://journals.iucr.org/d/issues/2011/04/00/ba5154/">this paper</a> for more information.

  <div class="section" id="what-is-CLD">
<h1>What is the <em>CLD</em> value reported in hand determination?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-CLD" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The <em>CLD</em> stands for correlation with local deviation and it is a statistical measure closely related to
the skewness of the map after density modification.  A larger value of <em>CLD</em> (around and above 2) for one
hand and a value close to 0 (or negative) for the other hand is a good sign indicating that there is a discrimination
between the hands.
