Prepare Complex Model
=====================

**MR Search Models** are structural templates prepared for use in molecular replacement programs (:doc:`Phaser <doc.task.Phaser>` and :doc:`Molrep <doc.task.Molrep>`). For the success of Molecular Replacement, MR model should be sufficiently similar to the target structure. This task prepares a complex (more than one domain) MR search model from atomic coordinates. A comma-separated list of **associated chains** needs to be provided.

The coordinates are usually modified (pruned) in order to remove parts that do not correspond to the target sequence. A few modification protocols are available:

    * **Unmodified**: atomic coordinates are not altered in any way

    * **PDB Clip**: removes solvent, hydrogens, and select most probable conformations

    * **Molrep**: modification protocol, based on the comparison of the target sequence and atomic coordinates, used by
      `Molrep <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2394799/>`_

    * **Sculptor**: modification protocols, based on the comparison of the target sequence and atomic coordinates, provided by
      ``Phaser.Sculptor`` (*cf.* `here <https://www.phaser.cimr.cam.ac.uk/index.php/Molecular_Replacement>`_)

    * **Chainsaw**: modification protocols, based on the comparison of the target sequence and atomic coordinates, provided by
      `Chainsaw <https://doi.org/10.1107/S0021889808006985>`_

    * **Polyalanine**: all residues are replaced with polyalanines

The resulting models can be used in both :doc:`Phaser <doc.task.Phaser>` and :doc:`Molrep <doc.task.Molrep>` tasks, which may give different outcome, especially in difficult cases.
