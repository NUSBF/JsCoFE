Structure Superposition with LsqKab
===================================

Superposition is the most common method for structure comparison. It is simply the process of rotating or orienting an object until it can be directly overlaid on top of a similar object. Structural superposition is used for comparison multiple conformations of the same protein (in case no alignment is necessary) and to evaluate the quality of alignments produced using only sequence information between two sequences whose structures are known. If you need to align two related proteins, you need to know which residues are equivalent. For doing so you can select limited regions of models for matching. The user can select the residues to superpose for each of the structures using the selection widget. You will be warned if you have not selected an equal number of residues for each structure.

.. note::
         one input element may be fixed as a reference and therefore its superposed coordinates do not change. And all of the molecules are moved to the position of one fixed "target" molecule which does not move.
