Prepare MR Ensemble from Sequence
=================================

**MR Ensembles** are superposed sets of sufficiently similar MR models, corresponding to the same target sequence. Using ensembles instead of singe models often increases chances of successful Molecular Replacement. This task uses :doc:`MrBump <doc.task.MrBump>` software to prepare MR Ensembles for given target sequence. The process is completely automatic and includes finding suitable structure homologs in the PDB and, optionally, AlphaFold 2 database, trimming them and bringing in best superposition. 

The task may prepare several MR Ensembles up to the specified number, depending on the quality of models found.
