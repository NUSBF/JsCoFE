Prepare MR Ensemble from Sequence
=================================

**MR Ensemble from Sequence** are superposed sets of sufficiently similar MR models, corresponding to the same target sequence, the use of which often leads to a higher success rate comparing to the use of MR Search Models. This task used only sequence information to prepare the MR Ensemble.

Ensembles performed by the PDB homologs search with or without AlphaFold 2 database.
