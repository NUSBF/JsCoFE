Prepare MR Model(s) from Alignment data
=======================================

Amino acid sequence similarity often correlates well with structural similarity. This task uses the `HHpred alignment <https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred>`_ for models generation. HHpred is suitable for more difficult cases where no obvious homologue is available. The sequence alignment generated in the search step can be used as a guide for the pruning of the homologue.

The coordinates are usually modified (pruned) in order to remove parts that do not correspond to the target sequence. A few modification protocols are available:

    * *Unmodified*: atomic coordinates are not altered in any way

    * *Clip*: water molecules and ligands are removed

    * *Molrep*: modification protocol, based on the comparison of the target sequence and atomic coordinates, used by
      `Molrep <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2394799/>`_

    * *Sculptor*: modification protocols, based on the comparison of the target sequence and atomic coordinates, provided by
      ``Phaser.Sculptor`` (*cf.* `here <https://www.phaser.cimr.cam.ac.uk/index.php/Molecular_Replacement>`_)

    * *Chainsaw*: modification protocols, based on the comparison of the target sequence and atomic coordinates, provided by
      `Chainsaw <https://doi.org/10.1107/S0021889808006985>`_

    * *Polyalanine*: all residues are replaced with polyalanines

The resulting models can be used in both ``Phaser`` and ``Molrep`` tasks, but the outcome may be different, especially in difficult cases.
