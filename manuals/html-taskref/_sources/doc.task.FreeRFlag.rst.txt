========================
Free R-flag (Regenerate)
========================

This program is used to tag each reflection with a R-flag or transfer FreeR assignments to a new data sets, or to isomorphous data sets such as substrate complexes. This is important if you plan to start refinement against new data using the previously refined model, or if you are combining different methods of refinement. In these cases it is essential to tag the SAME reflections.

**Free R-flag** is a fraction of reflections for use as "R free" (measure of model-to-data agreement) set during later refinement. 

A set of Free-R reflections is selected at random for a given set of observations. The proportion of the reflections assigned to the Free-R set defaults to 5% yet can be altered. FreeR_flag = 0 reflections remain untouched during refinement of the model.
The Free-R set is selected in the highest symmetry point group consistent with the current point group, in case the spacegroup has been wrongly determined.
