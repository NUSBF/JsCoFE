Automatic Experimental Phasing Workflow
=======================================

This task imports and prepares input data for solving structure with Automatic Experimental Phasing solver (Crank-2), and starts the corresponding *Workflow*. Once started, *Workflow* develops automatically, adding new tasks and branches in *Project Tree* as necessary, until arriving at the solution, or being stopped by user, or failing because of being unable to solve the structure. Read more about *Workflows* `here <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-userguide/jscofe_automated_workflows.html>`_. 

The *Automatic EP Workflow* includes the following stages:

- import of reflection dataset, target sequence and, optionally, ligand description
- preparation of :ref:`Asymmetric Unit <ASUDef>`
- Experimental Phasing with :ref:`Crank-2 <crank_doc>`
- :ref:`ligand fitting <ligands_built>` (if given on input) 
- solvent modelling
- deposition package preparation.
