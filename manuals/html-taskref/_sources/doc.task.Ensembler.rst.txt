===============================
Prepare MR Ensemble from Models
===============================

**MR Ensembles** are superposed sets of sufficiently similar MR models. Using MR Ensembles instead of individual MR models usually leads to a higher success rate of Molecular Replacement. Both :doc:`Phaser <doc.task.Phaser>` and :doc:`Molrep <doc.task.Molrep>` accept MR Ensembles likewise MR models. This task forms MR Ensemble from given models, by multiple superposing them with the :doc:`GESAMT <doc.task.Gesamt>` software

Trim levels
-----------

By default, the task will generate untrimmed ensemble, made of unmodified models, and ensembles with models trimmed to 100%, 80%, 60%, and 40% best matching residues, as identified via multiple structure alignment. You may change the set of trim levels by giving a comma-separated list of new trim values.
