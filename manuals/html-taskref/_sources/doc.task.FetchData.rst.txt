==============================================
Fetch Diffraction Images from WWW repositories
==============================================

This task retrieves raw X-ray diffraction data from public repositories using 
either a PDB code or a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) linked to the data. 
The following repositories are automatically searched:

* `SBGrid Data Bank <https://data.sbgrid.org/>`_
* `Protein Diffraction <https://proteindiffraction.org/>`_
* `X-ray Diffraction Archive (XRDA) <https://xrda.pdbj.org/>`_

The complete dataset will be downloaded and stored in the ``My Cloud Storage`` 
area at the path specified on the taskâ€™s *Report Page* upon completion.

Once fetched, the data can be processed using the 
:doc:`Automatic Image Processing with Xia-2 <doc.task.Xia2>` task.
Be sure to set the file location selector in the :doc:`Xia-2 <doc.task.Xia2>` 
task to ``cloud storage``.

.. note:: Each user has access only to their personal area in ``My Cloud Storage``.
.. note:: This task is unavailable in the CCP4 Cloud Local version.
