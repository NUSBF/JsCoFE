MR with model splitting using Slice-n-Dice
==========================================

Slice-n-Dice is an automated MR pipeline designed to pre-process AlphaFold2 and RosettaFold  models by removing low confidence regions and converting confidence scores into predicted B-factors. It also slices predicted models into distinct structural units then automatically placing the slices using Phaser. The slicing step can use AlphaFold2’s predicted aligned error (PAE), or can operate via a variety of Cɑ atom clustering algorithms, extending applicability to structures of any origin. 

Slice-n-Dice helps to deals with inaccuracy in domain-domain orientations of predicted models.

Slice
-----

Slice option in CCP4 cloud uses `Birch clustering algorithm <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#birch>`_ based on the coordinates of the Cɑ atoms.


The **number of splits** (clusters) can be specified. The large target protein needs to be modeled in several chunks. An increasing number of splits allows slice and dice to test a range of different splits.


The default **pLDDT threshold** for AlphaFold2 models is **70** and the default **RMS threshold** for RosettaFold models is **1.75**.

Dice
----

Dice method performs molecular replacement on the individual slices produced by Slice by :doc:`Phaser <doc.task.Phaser>`. Phaser automatically place as many slices as possible.  

:doc:`Molrep <doc.task.Molrep>` `Phased Translation Function (PTF) mode <http://journals.iucr.org/d/issues/2010/01/00/dz5175/>`_ is used to try and place the slices that could not be positioned in the initial Phaser job. After each MOLREP job, :doc:`REFMAC5 <doc.task.Refmac>` is used to assess if the placed slice has improved the solution.
