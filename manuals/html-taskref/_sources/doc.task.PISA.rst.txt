Surface, Interfaces and Assembly Analysis with PISA
===================================================

PISA (Protein Interfaces, Surfaces and Assemblies) performs the calculation of
macromolecular surfaces and interfaces and their various properties, and
predicts probable macromolecular assemblies (complexes).

PISA delivers the following data:

    * crystallised entities (monomers, chains) and their contacts (interfaces)
    * surface and interface areas, residues and atoms
    * hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and disulphide bonds in macromolecular interfaces
    * free energy of protein folding
    * energy of hydrophobic interaction between macromolecules and hydrophobic effect of individual residues
    * multiparametric assessment of macromolecular affinity (interaction radar)
    * probable macromolecular assemblies, their surface and buried areas, free energy of dissociation, dissociation patterns, relation to crystal interfaces and assemblage details
    * concentration profiles of assembly stock with stoichiometry defined by crystal content

On input, PISA requires only atomic coordinates of sufficiently well refined
structures. Do not use PISA if your structure is not yet complete and ready for PDB
deposition, because even a small imperfectness in crystal contacts may make
the difference between estimating a particular interface as binding or not.

PISA does not have any input parameters that should be manipulated by user.

**Basic principles**

PISA calculates macromolecular interfaces (crystal contacts) as surface patches
that have lost contact with the solvent upon crystallisation. For each
interface, PISA calculates the binding energy as a sum of contributions from
the solvation energy, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and entropy of immobilised
structural features (such as side chains) on macromolecular surface.

The calculate interface binding energies are used for the calculation of
free Gibbs energy of dissociation of all macromolacular assemblies that can
exist in given crystal packing. Assemblies with positive free Gibbs energy have
chances to exist in solution, and, therefore, are reported as probable
oligomeric states (complexes). A stable oligomeric state has chances to be
the Biological Unit, responsible for certain biochemical functions.

The stability of predicted oligomeric states is assessed on concentration
scale (*Stock analysis*), which may be useful for identifying bogus and promising
Biological Units.
