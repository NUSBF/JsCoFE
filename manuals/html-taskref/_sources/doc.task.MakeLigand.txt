Make Ligand with Acedrg
=======================

The `AceDRG <http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S2059798317000067>`_ is designed
for the derivation of stereo-chemical information about monomers/ligands (or small
molecules). It uses atom typing based on local chemical and topological environment
to organise bond lengths and angles from a small molecule database i.e.
the **Crystallography Open Database (COD)**. Information about hybridisation states
of atoms, small ring belongingness (up to seven membered rings), ring aromaticity
and nearest-neighbour information is encoded in the atom types. All atoms from COD
have been classified according to the generated atom types. All bonds and angles
have also been classified according to the atom types, and, in a certain sense,
bond types.

Using the tables containing those bonds and angles, **AceDRG can derive ideal bond
lengths, angles for an unknown monomer/ligand. It also generates information on
planar groups and stereo-chemical properties in the monomer/ligand**. 

-------------------------
What the task is used for
-------------------------

The **Make Ligand** task creates ligand description with AceDrg, using either a
`SMILE <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system>`_
string or the `standard 3-letter code <https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/staticHelp.do?p=help/advancedsearch/chemicalID.html>`_
for the ligand.

Ligand descriptions are essential for fitting ligands in electron density
maps, and are required for runnung the ligand-fitting tasks (**Model Building
with Coot** or **Fit Ligand with Coot**). After successful ligand fit, these
tasks place the ligand description in the output Structure Revision.

----------------------------------
Ligand descriptions and refinement
----------------------------------

Ligand descriptions are also essential for structure refinement with either
**Refmac** or **Buster**, if macromolecular model contains ligand coordinates. Both
**Refmac** and **Buster** tasks receive ligand descriptions as part of input
Structure Revision, usually after ligand fitting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What if ligands in structural model were not obtained with ligand fitting?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Indeed, structural model with ligand coordinates may be imported or obtained
from the PDB, in which case the corresponding ligand descriptions will be absent 
in Structure Revision, causing a failure in the refinement tasks. In this case:

    #. Import the corresponding ligand descriptions as ``*.cif`` files, or 
       generated them with the **Make Ligand** task
       
    #. Put them in Structure Revision using task **Edit Revision: Structure**
