Edit Revision: Asymmetric Unit
==============================

Estimating the number of molecules and solvent content in the asymmetric unit is one of the first steps in a macromolecular structure determination.  

Inaccurate estimations of solvent content may have a negative impact on phasing and density modification procedures, especially in difficult cases. Information about the fraction of water (solvent) plays a significant role in the X-ray structure determination process. Knowledge of the solvent content helps to determine the number of molecules in the asymmetric unit `[Matthews 1968] <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022283668902052?via%3Dihub>`_, which is crucial in early stages of crystal structure determination. It was found that proteins crystallizing in lower symmetry systems have lower solvent content compared to those crystallizing in higher symmetry systems `[Chruszcz 2008] <https://dx.doi.org/10.1110%2Fps.073360508>`_.  The revision of asymmetric unit content may be needed to estimate the solvent fraction.

Matthews coefficient
--------------------

Distribution of V :subscript:`M` , the crystal volume per unit of protein molecular weight, known as **Matthews coefficient**.  A significant percentage of the volume of protein crystals is occupied by solvent ranged from 27% to 78%, with the most common value being about 43%. `[Matthews 1968] <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022283668902052?via%3Dihub>`_.
The Matthews Coefficient and solvent content are calculated from the unit cell and the molecular weight of the molecules in the unit cell.

The probabilities from the Matthews coefficient (P :subscript:`matthews`) `[Kantardjieff and Rupp 2003] <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2323984/>`_  gives the probability of a particular Matthews coefficient based upon the high resolution limit.
