Asymmetric Unit and Structure Revision
======================================

This section contains tasks related to Asymmetric Unit and Structure Revision.

---------------
Asymmetric Unit
---------------

The **asymmetric unit (ASU)** is the smallest part of a crystal that, when duplicated *and moved by crystal symmetry operations*, can produce the **unit cell** of the crystal.

The **unit cell** is the part of a crystal that, when duplicated *and translated*, can generate the entire crystal.

The **symmetry operations** that are common for biological molecules are **rotation, translation, and screw operations** (which combine rotation and translation). Mirror symmetry planes occur rarely in crystals of biological molecules due to the presence of chiral centers, e.g. L or D amino acids.

The **ASU** is what is contained in the model that crystallographers publish in the **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**. 

.. Note::
        
        ASU is not to be confused with the Biologically Functional Unit, which may be the same, but also smaller, or larger than the ASU.

The definition of ASU is, therefore, as fundamental to structure solution as  the definition of Space Group and Unit Cell parameters, and must be done before on early stages of structure solution Project, before the *Phasing* stage.

------------------
Structure Revision
------------------

The Structure Revision is not a crystallographic notion. It may be seen as collection of data, which corresponds to the best knowledge of *crystal* achieved at the particular point of the structure solution Project. As an absolute minimum, **Structure Revision contains the definition of ASU and reference to the reflection data** , which is the absolute minimum required for the calculation of initial *phases*.

The minimal Structure Revision is generated by the "Definition of ASU Content" task. The rest of the structure solution process, then, may be seen as the addition of **phases** and **model coordinates** to Structure Revision, and improving them *via* repeat and consequitive cycles of model building and refinement.
