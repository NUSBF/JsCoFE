Model Building with Coot
========================

`Coot <https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/>`_ is a molecular-graphics application for model building and validation of biological macromolecules. Macromolecular model building using X-ray data is an interactive task involving the iterative application of various optimisation algorithms with evaluation of the model and interpretation of the electron density by the scientist. Coot is an interactive three-dimensional molecular-modeling program particularly designed for the building and validation of protein structures by facilitating the steps of the process.
