`MoRDa <http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S2053273315099672>`_ is a pipeline for automated molecular replacement protein structure solution based on its own domain database which derived from the PDB and contains a compact description of non-redundant protein chains, domains, homo- and hetero-oligomers.  Models relevant to the target sequence are further adjusted before molecular replacement search.The domain models are preprocessed to exclude flexible loops, which may hinder the molecular replacement search.
