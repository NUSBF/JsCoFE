findMySequence: protein sequence identification
===============================================

The `findMySequence <https://gitlab.com/gchojnowski/findmysequence>`_ is a neural-network-based approach for the identification of unknown proteins in X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. Given a protein model (side-chains are ignored) and corresponding crystallographic **2F** :subscript:`obs` **- F** :subscript:`calc` map the program will identify most likely sequence from a database.

The findMySequeden can be used for

• the identification of unknown proteins in your crystal (eg. contaminants) following structure determination with :doc:`SIMBAD <doc.task.Simbad>`

• validating sequence of an existing model (finding a sequence that better fits the data)

The findMySequence uses residue-type probability estimates and `HMMER <http://hmmer.org/>`_ suite for making queries. Hits are scored with E-value; the lower the E-value, the higher is the probability that a sequence is correct.

.. Note::
    There is usually no need to modify your model and map prior making queries; model-bias is already addressed in REFMAC's maximum likelihood **2F** :subscript:`obs` **- F** :subscript:`calc` maps. However, removing obvious tracing errors and gaps in the model followed by a quick restrained refinement may help to identify a correct sequence in difficult cases.

----------
Parameters
----------

**Model fragment selection** By default findMySequence will use complete input model for queries. Here, you can select specific chain or residue range.

.. Note::
    For heteromultimers chain sequences may be identified sequentially

**UniProt proteome identifier**  Identifier (UPID) of a proteome for querying sequences (will be downloaded automatically from UniProt). By default the program uses a database of all PDB sequences from :doc:`MrBump <doc.task.MrBump>`.

**Number of best sequence hits to show** By default 3 most plausible sequece hits are selected. This number can be increased if more hits are expected.
