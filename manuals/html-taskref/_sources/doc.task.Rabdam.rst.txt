When collecting data using X-rays, crystals can suffer damage that triggers localized chemical changes in macromolecules. This phenomenon, known as radiation damage, can lead to disulfide bond breakage and the loss of carboxyl groups from glutamate and aspartate side chains. If not accounted for, these changes can result in misleading biological interpretations.

Specific radiation damage manifests as chemical changes that elevate atomic *B*-factor values at affected sites. However, *B*-factors are also influenced by other factors, such as atomic mobility, making it challenging to isolate the effects of radiation damage from mobility alone.

Interestingly, there’s a strong link between an atom's mobility and its packing density—the number of atoms in its local environment. The *B*\ :sub:`Damage` metric cleverly adjusts the isotropic atomic *B*-factor to account for packing density. For an atom *j*, its *B*\ :sub:`Damage` value is calculated as the ratio of its *B*-factor to the average *B*-factor of atoms with similar packing density. This metric has been validated to pinpoint expected sites of specific radiation damage in macromolecular crystallography (MX) structures (Gerstel *et al.*, 2015).

The methodology for calculating an atom’s *B*\ :sub:`Damage` value is illustrated below:

  :alt: Diagram showing the steps to calculate the BDamage metric.

Here’s how it works: Starting with a PDB/mmCIF file of a protein crystal structure, RABDAM **(A)** generates a copy of the unit cell, followed by **(B)** a 3x3x3 assembly of unit cells. **(C)** Atoms in the assembly that are more than 7 Å away from the asymmetric unit are excluded. **(D)** The packing density of an atom *j* is calculated as the number of atoms within a 7 Å radius. **(E)** Atoms are grouped by packing density, and the *B*\ :sub:`Damage` value of atom *j* is calculated as the ratio of its *B*-factor to the average *B*-factor of atoms in similar packing density environments. Hydrogen atoms are excluded from these calculations.

The *B*\ :sub:`net` metric builds on *B*\ :sub:`Damage`, summarizing the total extent of specific radiation damage in a cryo-temperature protein crystal structure. A hallmark of radiation damage is the decarboxylation of Glu and Asp residues. The *B*\ :sub:`net` metric uses a kernel density estimate of the *B*\ :sub:`Damage` values of Glu and Asp side chain oxygen atoms. It’s defined as the ratio of the area under the curve on either side of the median *B*\ :sub:`Damage` distribution.

Since *B*\ :sub:`net` is weakly correlated with resolution, RABDAM introduces *B*\ :sub:`net`-percentile, a resolution-independent metric. This percentile ranks a structure's *B*\ :sub:`net` value within a subset of cryo-datasets closest in resolution (typically the 1000 nearest-resolution structures in the PDB). This makes *B*\ :sub:`net`-percentile the go-to metric for comparing damage across structures.

The process for calculating the *B*\ :sub:`net` value is summarized below:

To compute *B*\ :sub:`net`, RABDAM plots a kernel density estimate of the *B*\ :sub:`Damage` values of Glu and Asp side chain oxygen atoms. The area under the curve to the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the median *B*\ :sub:`Damage` value is measured, and *B*\ :sub:`net` is calculated as LHS divided by RHS.

RABDAM provides a comprehensive analysis of specific radiation damage by calculating *B*\ :sub:`Damage`, *B*\ :sub:`net`, and *B*\ :sub:`net`-percentile metrics for any standard-format PDB or mmCIF file. While *B*\ :sub:`Damage` can be calculated for any macromolecule, the *B*\ :sub:`net` and *B*\ :sub:`net`-percentile metrics are tailored for cryo-temperature protein crystal structures.

Data Requirements
------------------

To use RABDAM, you’ll need a standard-format PDB or mmCIF file containing a single model of your crystal structure. The file must include ATOM/HETATM records, as well as details about the space group, resolution, and temperature. Since *B*\ :sub:`Damage` is a per-atom metric, it should only be calculated for structures where *B*-factors have been refined per-atom, typically near the final stages of refinement. Additionally, ensure that non-ligand atoms subject to occupancy refinement are limited to alternate conformers, with occupancies summing to 1.
