`SIMBAD <https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798318005752>`_ (Sequence-Independent Molecular replacement Based on Available Databases) is used for both contaminant and brute-force approaches for molecular replacement. It designed to check for the presence of a contaminant. Pipeline is also useful in cases of the misidentification of a crystal and can also be useful in scenarios where no obvious homologue is available as a search model or the most suitable search model is not among those most highly ranked by sequence comparisons. 

SIMBAD contains three major steps: 

* a lattice-parameter search against the entire Protein Data Bank, rapidly determining whether or not a homologue exists in the same crystal form.

* a contaminant search, a not uncommon occurrence in macromolecular crystallography. To catch for this eventuality, SIMBAD rapidly screens the data against a database of known contaminant structures. This database is compiled to include entries from `ContaBase <https://strube.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/contaminer/contabase>`_ and `Dimple <http://ccp4.github.io/dimple/>`_.

* the non redundant PDB MoRDa database search (referred as structural database search). SIMBAD performs the rotation search ∼90000 times using Phaser likelihood-enhanced fast rotation function `[Simpkin et al. 2020] <https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798319015031>`_. The models are used as they are defined in the MoRDa database with no additional modifications. Each is then ranked by Z-score and the top 200 solutions are passed on to MOLREP followed by REFMAC5 to perform full MR and refinement.
