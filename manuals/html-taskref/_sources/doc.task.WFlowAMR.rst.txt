Automatic Molecular Replacement Workflow
========================================

This task imports and prepares input data for solving structure with an Automatic Molecular Replacement solver (MrBump or MoRDa), and starts the corresponding *Workflow*. Once started, *Workflow* develops automatically, adding new tasks and branches in *Project Tree* as necessary, until arriving at the solution, or being stopped by user, or failing because of being unable to solve the structure. Read more about `here <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-userguide/jscofe_automated_workflows.html>`__

The *Automatic MR Workflow* includes the following stages:

- import of reflection dataset, target sequence and, optionally, ligand description
- checking PDB for identical lattice parameters with :ref:`Simbad <simbad_doc>`; 
- preparation of :ref:`Asymmetric Unit <ASUDef>`
- Molecular Replacement with either `MrBump <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.MrBump.html>`_ or :ref:`MorDA <morda_doc>`
- if a solution is found, either by *Simbad*, *MrBump* or *MoRDa*:
    - model building with `Modelcraft <./doc.task.ModelCraft.html>`_
    - structure refinement
    - :ref:`ligand fitting <ligands_built>` (if ligand is given)
    - solvent modelling
    - deposition package preparation
