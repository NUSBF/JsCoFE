Automatic Molecular Replacement Workflow
========================================

This task imports and prepares input data for solving structure with an Automatic Molecular Replacement solver (MrBump or MoRDa), and starts the corresponding *Workflow*. Once started, *Workflow* develops automatically, adding new tasks and branches in *Project Tree* as necessary, until arriving at the solution, or being stopped by user, or failing because of being unable to solve the structure. Read more about *Workflows* here. 

The *Automatic MR Workflow* includes the following stages:

- import of reflection dataset, target sequence and, optionally, ligand description
- checking PDB for identical lattice parameters with *Simbad*; 
- preparation of Asymmetric Unit
- Molecular Replacement with either *MrBump* or *MorDA*
- if a solution is found, either by *Simbad*, *MrBump* or *MoRDa*, the structure is built with *CCP4Build* or *Buccaneer*, refined, ligand is fit (if given), solvent modelled and deposition package prepared.
