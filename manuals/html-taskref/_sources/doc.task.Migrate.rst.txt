Hop on CCP4 Cloud
=================

Hop on CCP4 Cloud task was made for continuation of structure solution projects from other interfaces. 

As input user can provide:

*  **Reflection data**: unmerged or merged `mtz <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/mtzformat.html>`_ file

.. note:: `CCP4 Cloud does NOT allow users to upload diffraction images <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-userguide/jscofe_tips.Work_with_diffraction_images.html>`_
  
*  **Phases information**: can be represented as Phis (angles) and FOMs (figures of merit) or as Hendrickson-Lattmann (HL) coefficients which are a set of four numbers per reflection in `mtz <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/mtzformat.html>`_ file. Estimated phases are first generated by refinement after molecular replacement or by experimental phasing.
  
*   **Atomic coordinates**: `.pdb <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/pdbformat.html>`_,  `.cif <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4894604/>`_,  `.mmcif <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/mmcifformat.html>`_
  
*   **Ligand description** (if present): required for running ligand-fitting tasks (`Model Building with Coot <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.CootMB.html>`_ or `Fit Ligand with Coot <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.FitLigand.html>`_). After successful ligand fit, these tasks place the ligand description in the output Structure Revision.
  
    Please refer to the `Chemical Component Dictionary <https://www.wwpdb.org/data/ccd>`_ and `Ligand descriptions <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/intro_mon_lib.html>`_ pages for further description

Hop on CCP4 Cloud task **create** the `Structure Revision <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-userguide/jscofe_qna.structure_revision.html>`_ **automatically**.
