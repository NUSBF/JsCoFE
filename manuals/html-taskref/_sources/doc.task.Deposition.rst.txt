Prepare data for deposition
===========================

The final stage of the crystallographic structure solution is the deposition of the final structure model, sequence, ligand data, and observations in the `Protein Data Bank (PDB) <https://www.wwpdb.org/>`_. The deposition is done by means of two `mmCIF <https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/beginner%E2%80%99s-guide-to-pdb-structures-and-the-pdbx-mmcif-format>`_ -formatted files: one containing atomic coordinates, sequence(s) and ligand descriptions, and one containing the observations (*i.e.*, reflection dataset(s)). Both files are prepared by the Deposition task. The task examines the current project branch, finds the needful data and puts them in the resulting mmCIF files.

.. note ::
    The task does not actually deposit data in the PDB. It only prepares mmCIF files for deposition and acquires the PDB Validation report from wwPDB servers.

After Deposition task finishes, inspect the `PDB Validation Report <https://www.wwpdb.org/validation/validation-reports>`_, delivered by task. If you find that the structure is worth deposition, then:

    * Download the `mmCIF <https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/beginner%E2%80%99s-guide-to-pdb-structures-and-the-pdbx-mmcif-format>`_ files with final model (which also contains sequence(s) and ligand descriptions) and reflection data, using **Download buttons** in the task output page. 
  
    * Start new deposition session at `wwPDB Deposition Site <https://deposit.wwpdb.org/>`_ (`X-ray Deposition tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFMG_cFebTA>`_).

.. note ::
    The PDB accepts both merged (mandatory) and scaled unmerged (optional) reflection data. In CCP4 Cloud, scaled unmerged dataset is created by the `Merging and Scaling with Aimless <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.Aimless.html>`_ task. If this task was run in the current project branch, the scaled unmerged dataset will be found by the Deposition task automatically. In such case, the task produces mmCIF files for both the merged, and combined merged and scaled unmerged datasets. Of those, only one should be chosen for deposition at user's discretion. Deposition of scaled unmerged data is encouraged in all cases.
