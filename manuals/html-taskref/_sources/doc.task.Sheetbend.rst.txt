Post-MR model correction with Sheetbend
=======================================

`SHEETBEND <https://pure.york.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/sheetbend-software-for-model-morphing-of-atomic-models(497dd49d-c29c-4958-863b-18563a7dde17).html>`_ performs model morphing by `shift-field refinement <https://journals.iucr.org/d/issues/2020/12/00/di5041/>`_. This is a very fast form of preliminary refinement which can be applied as a precursor to conventional refinement. It can be applied at any resolutions, and when used at low resolution is particularly suited to correcting large shifts in secondary structure elements in molecular replacement. Sheetbend can also be used to refine B factors.

The program outputs an R-factor and free R-factor at the start of each cycle (can be found in **Main Log** tab) 


.. note:: R-factors are based on the reflections used for a given cycle, which may change if the resolution changes from cycle to cycle. Values are therefore not comparable from cycle to cycle unless the resolution is unchanged. As a result the values are only really useful for evaluating radius settings using the same resolution settings.
