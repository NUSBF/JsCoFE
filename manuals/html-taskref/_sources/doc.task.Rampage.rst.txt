RAMPAGE is a consequence of RAPPER which generates a Ramachandran plot by data derivative by `the Richardsons and coworkers <https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.10286>`_

RAPPER performs conformer modelling through sampling residue-specific phi / psi propensity tables and rotameric states with given a set of restraints.

The Ramachandran diagram plots phi versus psi dihedral angles for each residue in the output pdb file. The diagram is divided into favored, allowed and disallowed regions, whose contouring is based on density dependent smoothing for 81234 non-Glycine, non-Proline and non-preProline residues with B < 30 from 500 high-resolution protein structures. Regions are also defined for Glycine, Proline, and pre-Proline.


RAMPAGE is used to verify protein models for possible errors.
