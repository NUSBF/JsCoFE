PDB-REDO can automatically optimise most of the existing structures to derive improved, up-to-date structure models based on the original experimental data that were deposited with the atomic coordinates in the PDB. PDB-REDO performs "constructive validation" by ensuring that the refinement parameters are consistent and optimal, and by proactively rebuilding the model. This process goes beyond just correcting errors in the structure, but also aims to achieve the best possible interpretation of the electron density data. PDB_REDO checks every amino-acid side chain to determine whether an alternative rotameric conformation can be found with an equal or better fit to the electron density.


The PDB-REDO procedure consists of:

#. model refinement in `REFMAC <./doc.task.Refmac.html>`_

#. rebuilding by **Centrifuge** 
    
    removes all waters with low weighted mean density fit to the 2mFo − DFc map [fit(ρ) < 0.37]. This resolution-independent cutoff value used within PDB-REDO was optimized to minimize the false-positive rate, i.e. to ensure that waters were not deleted where they should be kept

    (re)builds side chains in rotameric conformations.

#. `pepflip <https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fbioinformatics%2Fbtr590>`_ 
    
    flips the orientation of peptide planes in the model if this improves the fit of the peptide with, in order of importance, the mFo − DFc map at the position of the oxygen, the 2mFo − DFc map of the whole peptide and a combination of the two fits and the geometry, while maintaining or improving the backbone torsion angles with respect to the `Ramachandran plot <https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-2836(63)80023-6>`_ of the two residues involved.

#. validation in `WHAT_CHECK <https://www.nature.com/articles/381272a0>`_

Additional validation is performed by `pdb-care <https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-5-69>`_ for carbohydrates and `FoldX <https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-2836(02)00442-4>`_ for calculation of the Gibbs folding energy.
