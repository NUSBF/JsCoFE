===========
Data Import
===========


Data import is almost always the first task in any Project (only the **Make Ligand** task may be run without any data imported). There may be as many data imports in projects as necessary, however, it is usually a good idea to import all available experimental data, sequences and molecular coordinates in the very beginning.

*From user's perspective, CCP4 Cloud operates with data objects, rather than raw files. There are only 2 points where a user deals with actual files: (1) importing and (2) exporting data to/from CCP4 Cloud Project. Data objects correspond to entities that are passed from task to task as a whole. Therefore, for all tasks, except Data Import, require choice of data objects, rather than raw files. This is done in form of drop-down selectors, pre-filled with data objects, relevant to particular task and input field only*

Data Object Naming

        **From user's perspective, CCP4 Cloud operates with data objects, rather than raw files. There are only 2 points where a user deals with actual files: (1) importing and (2) exporting data to/from CCP4 Cloud Project. Data objects correspond to entities that are passed from task to task as a whole.**

All data objects are named according to the following template:
``[NNNN-MM] name /type/subtype(s)``

where:

=============      ===========================================================================================================================================================================================================
    NNNN    	  	Serial number of job, which produced the data object
	MM	     	    Serial number of data object in the job, which produced it
	name      		Given name, which can be derived either from the name of related file imported to the Project, or from program or task name that created the respective data, or from the output id of the Job Dialog
	type     		Type of data object (see above)
 subtype(s) 		Optional subtypes (see above)
=============      ===========================================================================================================================================================================================================

Data Object Visibility
++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, each new job has access to data objects, imported or generated by all its parent jobs. For example:


    .. image:: images/doc.task.import1.png
        :scale: 50 %


job [0008] has access to data imported in job [0001], MR model(s) made in job [0002] and structures produced by jobs [0006] and [0007]. However, job [0008] cannot (by default) access structures produced by jobs [0003] and [0004] because they belong to a different branch of job tree.
If you may need to use data from different branches in a subsequent job. For example, you may want to structurally compare outputs of jobs [0005] and [0008] , using Gesamt software. This can be done by multiple selection of jobs, outcome of which needs to be used, and then right-clicking on one of them in order to add the new job through the dropdown menu


    .. image:: images/doc.task.import2.png
        :scale: 50 %


Choosing "Add job" from the dropdown menu will bring up the Task List Dialog, from which the "Structural comparison with Gesamt" task can be chosen. The new job will be added as a child to the right-clicked job ([0008] in the above Figure) and will see only data produced in jobs selected.

Data Objects and Project Branching
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Limitation of data visibility along branches of the job tree helps to keep the content of input data selectors in job dialogs as concise and relevant as possible. For new jobs, CCP4 Cloud will always offer initially data settings based on most recently generated data (in given branch of the job tree), as well as associated data. For example, a new refinement job will have, as initial settings, the most recently produced Structure Data and reflection dataset (HKL) used to produce it. However, you can always change these settings, e.g., in order to refine structure against another compatible dataset.

It is therefore clear that you want to grow your Project (the job tree) in such a way that needed data is always in the scope, and you do not have to resort to breaking the default behaviour by adjusting the data visibility scope with multiple job selection. Following these principles will help to keep your projects in the most logical way, where the structure solution pathway can be easily identified (as a branch that led to best results).

The disadvantage of non-branching is the gradual lose of clarity of the structure solution process with growing number of trials, as well as growing inconvenience of dealing with long lists of input data to be chosen for new tasks. While these disadvantages do not seem to be dramatic in case of simple short projects, they may become critical in not so unusual case of projects having 100s of jobs.

CCP4 Cloud does not impose any specific rules for project branching. However, it may be convenient to branch when you:
    •	start working with a new crystal / reflection dataset
    •	start a new route of structure solution (e.g. trying to solve structure stage-by-stage after a failure of automated solvers)
    •	try another method of phasing (e.g. EP after MR); however, do not branch if you are planning a hybrid phasing, such as using MR phases in combination with those obtained from heavy atom location
    •	start working with new model for molecular replacement
    •	change the composition of asymmetric unit
    •	want to rerun the same job with different input parameters (job cloning)

File formats
------------

CCP4 Cloud operates with data objects, rather than raw files. There are only 2 points where a user deals with actual files: (1) importing and (2) exporting data to/from CCP4 Cloud Project.
Import procedure automatically identifies the type of uploaded data and converts it into CCP4 Cloud's Data Objects

MTZ reflection format
---------------------

The MTZ file format is used for the storage of reflection data. The file contains the data and a header of metadata. The former is held as a table with rows representing reflections and columns representing different quantities for each reflection. The latter aims to make the file self-contained by including all necessary information, such as symmetry operations, cell dimensions, etc. The MTZ file is a flat-file representation of a particular data model.


There are exist two different types of mtz files:

• **unmerged** is a file type in which original individual reflections are kept separate.

• **merged**  is file type in which all reflections merged from multiple measurements of symmetry equivalent reflections and also the different components of reflections that are partially recorded over a number of adjacent images.

The file contains basically two classes of records - header records and reflection data records.

The HKL file
------------
A HKL file consists of x-ray reflections related to reflection planes (hkl) of the crystal lattice. Each of these planes obeys Bragg's equation. The experimental reflections are characterised by the indices h k l, a measured intensity I and its error sigma(I).
