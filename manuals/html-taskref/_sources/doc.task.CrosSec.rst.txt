X-ray cross sections and anomalous scattering factors
=====================================================

The task interpolates X-ray cross sections and computes anomalous scattering factors. f’ and f’’ values are derived for a given atom type at given wavelengths. These are important for data collection and analysis with heavy atoms.

The atomic symbol for the element of interest is required as an input (case-insensitive).

In order to **Make scattering factors plot** user should define the minimum photon energy in KeV in the given range.

Task output provides the **anomalous scattering factors plot for atom type**.


In order to **Compute scattering factors for the following selected photon energies** a list of the wavelengths (in Angstroms) should be given.

In this case, the task output provides the **anomalous scattering factors plot for atom type** and a **Selected anomalous scattering factors for atom type** table.
