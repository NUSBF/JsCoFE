Automated Model Building with Arp/wArp
======================================

`ARP/wARP <https://www.embl-hamburg.de/ARP/>`_ is a software suite for building macromolecular models in electron density maps. As a distinguishing feature of ARP/wARP approach, model building starts from interpreting a density map with free atoms of unknown chemical identity; all structural information for such chemically unassigned atoms is discarded. 
 
**ARP/wARP** implementation in CCP4 Cloud tackles several tasks: 

 * iterative protein model building including a high-level decision-making control module

 * fast construction of the secondary structure of a protein

 * building flexible loops in alternate conformations


In general, **ARP/wARP** performs better at higher resolution; yet successful automated building of a considerable part of the model is possible at resolution as low as `2.8 Å <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16537422/>`_. As a rough guideline, models are typically built to a completeness of ~80% at resolution around 2.6 Å and higher. At 3 Å resolution, the average model completeness decreases down to ∼75%, and down to 65% in the 3.5 Å resolution limit.

However, the ligand and loop building modules are applicable in many projects where the automated model building does not succeed. Finally, the **secondary structure recognition module** extends the applicability of the procedure to low resolution data (4.5 Å).

Free atoms and hybrid models
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ultimate goal of model building is to condense the information of the electron density map to a crystallographic molecular model, made by atoms with known chemical identity. 

As a first step towards building a model, ARP/wARP condenses the map information to a set of ‘free atoms’ that have no chemical identity (*these atoms are carefully chosen to represent the electron density in a best possible way*) but, in their distribution, keep resemblance to a protein-like shape. 

As the model building and refinement proceed, some of the free atoms get recognised as part of a protein chain and gain chemical identity, while others remain 'free'. This mixture of assigned and uninterpreted atoms represents the ARP/wARP hybrid model, which benefits from: 

* incorporation of chemical knowledge from the partially built protein model, while 'free' atoms continue to represent electron density in areas where no model is yet available 

* use of 'free' atom positions as guides for model building in the electron density maps, which allows for the implementation of computationally efficient algorithms


**Number of macrocycles**

The default is 10 building cycles each including 5 ARP/REFMAC cycles (thus making 50 cycles in total). If initial phases are good, the autobuilding may converge faster; more cycles may be required in case of poor phases. 


**Conditional Restraints**

       * the use of conditional restraints does NOT have adverse effects on model completeness, and this result justifies their use as default in ARP/wARP*

'Free' atoms serve two main purposes: 

* obtain better electron density maps through refinement

* during model building, provide Cα guides for the protein backbone tracing and sequence assignment

Both above work very well in case of high-resolution data, when individual atoms are recognizable in electron density and a sufficient number of observations for refinement is available. In such a case, most of the 'free' atoms are found approximately in the right place. At lower resolutions, however, it becomes difficult to distinguish between individual atoms. Also, it becomes difficult to refine the partially built structure and remaining 'free' atoms with a limited number of experimental observations and no chemical restraints. As a result, the errors in the positions of the 'free' atoms become larger, and the quality of electron density maps significantly poorer. A way to remedy this situation is by adding structural information either in the context of the 'free' atoms model or the hybrid model.

Conditional optimization provides one solution to this problem. In this approach, no final chemical assignments are ever made, but instead, all possible assignments are considered simultaneously `(Scheres and Gros, 2004) <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15572773/>`_.

**Force conditional restraints for very large structures**

This option will force using the conditional restraints for very large structures, where ARP/wARP might otherwise choose to suppress them for the CPU efficiency reasons. There is no need to use this option, unless you see a warning message that they were turned off, in which case you may want to give them a try at the expense of the increased execution time. **The default is not to use**.

**Model building with resolution extension**

The **Fake data** algorithm extends experimental data to a higher resolution and uses a combination of electron density maps, calculated for the experimental and extended data sets, for model building. The resulting model is refined against the experimental data again.

**Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS)**

NCS arises if there are multiple copies of subunits or their assemblies in the asymmetric unit of a crystal and these copies adopt almost the same fold (tertiary structure). In ARP/wARP, the derived NCS relations are used to improve the model so that the built fragments can be extended and become more accurate. In essence, ARP/wARP exploits the fact that during the automated model building, NCS-related subunits are not built in exactly the same manner. Because of that, each NCS-related copy of the structure contains information that may be lacking in another copy. Combining the information from several copies helps to increase the overall structural completeness and quality. 

.. Note::
    NCS-extended fragments are only used as potential Cα seeds (suggestions) to ARP/wARP for building longer chain fragments. Therefore, the method is not expected to build parts of the structure that lack support for coordinate placement in terms of electron density and plausible stereochemistry. Thus, if some parts of the NCS-related copies of the model are similar, then their convergence to similar conformations will be accelerated by the method. If, in contrast, there are genuine differences between the NCS-related copies, then the NCS-extended suggestions will not match the density and will likely not be used to build the chain.

The accuracy of NCS extension depends predominantly on the completeness of the initial model, its degree of fragmentation and the coordinate accuracy (*i.e.,* very good results may still be obtained for many residues missing from a nearly correct NCS copy). 

The use of NCS extension in model building is always advantageous, but the degree of improvement depends strongly on the completeness, fragmentation and correctness of the model, which all depend on the phase quality and data properties.

**Building missing loops in a protein model** 

**Loopy** is a program that generates sets of candidate loops for short stretches (up to 14) of missing residues, given the anchors and the sequence of the missing residues. Each candidate loop includes both main chain and side chain atoms with the average root-mean-square deviation of Cα atoms across the set being less than 0.4 Å. When used in the context of automated model building in ARP/wARP, Loopy can increase the completeness of the built models.

.. Note::
    A protein model and an X-ray data to 3.0 Å resolution or higher are required.

**Docking chains to sequence**

Automated model building using ARP/wARP proceeds in an iterative manner when main-chain fragments are identified and built in a density map, followed by their docking to the known protein sequence. Docking chains to sequence is performed using machine-learning-based docking of main-chain fragments to the sequence and for their sequence-independent connection using a dedicated library of protein fragments. This step not only helps to increase the completeness of the model but, more importantly, can identify gaps between the chain fragments for subsequent completion using sequence information. These approaches provide excellent results at high and medium resolution when the experimental X-ray data provide a sufficiently high observation-to-parameter ratio. However, their performance is considerably reduced at lower resolution (usually worse than 2.5 Å).

The new sequence-docking method implemented in `ARP/wARP 8.0 <http://www.embl-hamburg.de/ARP/>`_, is less sensitive to the accuracy of the model backbone, on comparison with the previously used method. It does not explicitly use the positions of 'free' atoms and thus yields more reliable residue type predictions for low-resolution density maps and in case of higher phase error.

The default is to dock the fragments starting from building cycle 0. This may be changed, although may be not advantageous. 

**Search for helices and strands before each building cycle**

**This is the default for resolution of 2.7 Å or lower**. Enabling this option may also be advantageous for model building at higher resolutions. Should the model obtained from helix/strands tracing be more complete than the one from warpNtrace, the appropriate message will be printed at the end of the short Main log file.

**Density modification prior autobuilding**

This step improves the density map by optmising positions of 'free' atoms (without channging the current model) and requires X-ray data to about 2.5 Å resolution or higher.
