Structure Prediction
====================	

Task designed for prediction a protein’s 3D structure from amino acid sequence with `ColabFold <https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb>`_ or `Openfold <https://colab.research.google.com/github/aqlaboratory/openfold/blob/main/notebooks/OpenFold.ipynb>`_ services.

**Predicted Aligned Error (PAE)** reports AlphaFold’s expected position error of predicted residue regarding the structure aligned. PAE is useful for assessing confidence in global features (molecule interface), especially domain packing. **Low PAE** suggests **AlphaFold is confident** about the relative domain positions. Meanwhile, **high PAE** values suggest the relative positions of the domains should not be interpreted.


**PLLDT scores plot** shows the pLDDT score per position for each of the five AlphaFold models predicted.

AlphaFold produces a per-residue estimate of its confidence score (**pLDDT**) ranging from 0 to 100. 
                
* **pLDDT > 90**: residues are expected to be positioned with a high accuracy. These models should be suitable for any application that benefits from high accuracy (e.g. characterising binding sites).
                
* **70 < pLDDT < 90** residues are expected to be positioned reasonably well (generally, a good backbone prediction).
                
* **50 < pLDDT < 70** corresponds to residues modelled with low confidence, which should be treated with caution.
                
* **pLDDT < 50** indicates residues that should not be interpreted. Such scores are a reasonably strong predictor of disorder, i.e. they suggest that the region is either unstructured in physiological conditions, or gets structured only as part of a complex.

**Sequence coverages plot** shows the number of homologous identified across the representative sequence and coloured by the sequence identity to query.
