Contact calculations
====================

This task computes various types of contacts in protein structures using 
CONTACT program from CCP4. It can also analyse water hydrogen bonding.

The task requires a user to set up keyword-value pairs directly, using
`CONTACT documentation <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/contact.html>`_.

.. note::
        The task uses XYZ data from the chosen input object and does not create 
        any output data objects. All output (which is list of contacts) is 
        found in the *Main Log* tab and may be downloaded as a text file using 
        the *Download* button provided in the main *Report* tab.
