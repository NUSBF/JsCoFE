==================
Push Data to Cloud
==================

This task transfers X-ray diffraction image directories from your device to the
``My Cloud Storage`` area in CCP4 Cloud. Instead of sending individual files,
it uploads entire directories, supporting up to 10 directories per task.

In the task interface, you can choose a custom name for the destination folder,
or allow an auto-generated name. The full path to the destination folder will be
displayed on the taskâ€™s *Report Page* upon completion.

Once the transfer is complete, the data can be processed using the 
:doc:`Automatic Image Processing with Xia-2 <doc.task.Xia2>` task.
Be sure to set the file location selector in the :doc:`Xia-2 <doc.task.Xia2>` 
task to ``cloud storage``.

.. note:: Each user has access only to their personal area in ``My Cloud Storage``.
.. note:: Multiple source directories will be merged into a single destination 
          folder in ``My Cloud Storage``.
.. note:: This task is unavailable in the CCP4 Cloud Local version.
