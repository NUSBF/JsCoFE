Automated refinement and ligand fitting workflow
================================================

Refinement and Ligand fitting Workflow perform automatic structure refinement with optimization of Refmac parameters and fitting water molecules. 

Once started, *Workflow* develops automatically, adding new tasks and branches in *Project Tree* as necessary, until arriving at the solution, or being stopped by user, or failing because of being unable to solve the structure. Read more about `here <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-userguide/jscofe_automated_workflows.html>`_.


.. note:: Refinement and Ligand fitting Workflow can be started in previously developed Project tree.

The *Automatic Refinement and Ligand fitting Workflow* includes the following stages:

- structure refinement with `Refmac <./doc.task.Refmac.html>`_
- :ref:`ligand fitting <ligands_built>` (if ligand is given)
- solvent modelling
- deposition package preparation
