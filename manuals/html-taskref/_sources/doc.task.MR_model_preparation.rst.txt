Molecular Replacement Models and Ensembles
==========================================

**MR Search Models** are structural templates prepared for the use by molecular replacement programs (Phaser and Molrep). MR model may coincide with the homologous structure, however, in many cases it is represented by a selected part of it, which is expected to be most close to target molecule. In CCP4 Cloud, MR search model is associated with sequence it represents.

A well-chosen and optimised search model has two key advantages:

    1. Facilitates the work MR program of finding the correct position for that search model and hence sensible starting phases

    2. Facilitates quicker and easier model building and refinement post MR

In MR, the coordinates of a search model are converted to a calculated structure-factor set for comparison with the experimental data. It has been known for a while that MR search models clustered and aligned into ensembles can be more effective than the individual models themselves.

**MR Ensembles** are superposed sets of sufficiently similar MR models, corresponding to the same target sequence, the use of which often leads to a higher success rate comparing to the use of MR Search Models. In CCP4 Cloud, MR ensemble is associated with target sequence it represents.

MR Search Model(s) and/or MR Ensemble(s) must be prepared before molecular replacement with either Phaser or Molrep. CCP4 Cloud contains several tasks for this purpose.
