Automatic Image Processing with Xia-2
=====================================


`Xia-2 <https://doi.org/10.1107/S0021889809045701>`_ is a system for macromolecular crystallography data reduction is presented, which builds on existing software to automate the complete data reduction process from images to merged structure factor amplitudes. This can automatically identify multi-wedge, multi-pass and multiwavelength data sets and includes explicit procedures to test for crystallographic special cases.

Although Xia-2 can operate in a completely automatic way, there is an options user can find at input page. This can be used to specify the data set and sweep names, define
reference reflection files,choose the heavy atom type if exists, limit the extent of data used and **select the processing pipeline** to use (press on **Contents** to find information about CCP4 Cloud tasks you can select).

• Check graphs - they should vary smoothly without obvious discontinuities. If there are discontinuities in the graphs, they often occur around the same images for different graphs. Look at any images in the region of the discontinuities and see if there is anything obviously wrong with them

• I/sigma(I) at (high resolution limit-~0.2Å) should be ≳1. If the graphs corresponding to I/sigma(I) fall gradually to lower values towards the end of the dataset, it is usually an indication that the crystal is exhibiting radiation damage.

• Check half-dataset correlation coefficient: **CC1/2** represents split observations for each reflection randomly into 2 halves, and calculate the correlation coefficient between them (or equivalent calculation). Not dependent on σ(I). **CC1/2** = 1 is perfect, **CC1/2** = 0 is no correlation. ``Common value for cutoff is 0.3 or 0.5.``

• Signal/noise estimates: **I/sig(I)**  it relies on σ(I), which is not entirely reliable. Cut resolution at <I/σ(I)> after averaging Mn(I/sd) = 1 – 2

• **R-factors (Rmerge, Rpim, Rmeas)** Shouldn’t be used to determine resolution cutoffs. Historically used, so useful to compare to previous practises.
   
    **Rmerge** : traditional overall measures of quality, but increases with multiplicity although the data improves (tends to infinity as data gets weaker). Should be relatively stable **Rmerge** across all batches. **Rmerge** is always large for small intensities. ``For large intensities it should be in the range 0.01 to 0.04 for good data`` . Larger values suggest that there are systematic errors. 
    
    **Rpim** : “Precision-indicating R-factor” gets better (smaller) with increasing multiplicity, ie it estimates the precision of the merged <I>. 
    
    **Rmeas** Multiplicity-weighted, better (but larger).
