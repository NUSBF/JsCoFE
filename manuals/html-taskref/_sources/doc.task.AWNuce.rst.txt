Automatic RNA/DNA Building with Arp/wArp (NUCE)
===============================================

**NUCE** is a shortcut to **Arp/wArp**'s nucleotide building functionality.
Giving approximation to phases in *Structure Revision*, **NUCE** identifies
candidate phosphate positions in electron density, which is then used for
building the nucleotide backbone and, finally, nucleic acid bases. The 
resulting polynucleotides *replace* any existing nucleic acid chains 
in *Structure Revision*.

**NUCE** performs a single act of building as described above, and does not 
refine the resulting structure or improve phases. These operations should be 
performed by appropriate programs. Good results are obtained when **NUCE** uses
modified phases (*e.g.,* after **Parrot**) and results are refined using 
**Refmac** (*e.g.,* 10 iterations with jelly-body restraints). Usually, a 
few iterations **Parrot** -- **NUCE** -- **Refmac** are required. This
approach is exemplified in Atlas entry A4.1.1.

-------
Options
-------

**NUCE** works completely automatically and has no options or parameters to 
manipulate with.

.. note::
   **NUCE** can built nucleotide chains in arbitrary location; in such case,
   they should be brought in the proximity of protein chains by suitable
   symmetry transformation, *e.g.,* by using **Coot**.
