<p>This tutorial is based on a set of images collected from a crystal of selenomethionine-containing CD44 protein.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.</span></code> The protein sequence has been already imported and can be found in the output of the <strong>Cloud Import</strong> task.</p>

<p class="last">Resolution limits and Spacegroup are normally determined by examining the data, but it is possible to enter them here if you have prior knowledge.</p>

<div class="admonition note">

<p class="last">Xia2 outputs two or more unmerged datasets, and one merged dataset. The latter contains anomalous data only if heavy atom type is specified in task input parameters. Otherwise, only mean intensities will be computed.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Look for the plot of CC(1/2) vs resolution</strong> (<strong>Dataset SAD</strong> =&gt; <strong>Analysis by resolution</strong> section). It plots the correlation coefficient for randomly selected half sets of the intensities in dataset with each other. When CC(1/2) value has fallen substantially below 1.0 it indicates that the data have become weak and internally inconsistent (<em>it is a good idea not to include such data in calculations</em>). By default, this Xia2 job has cut off our data at a resolution where CC(1/2) drops to 0.5 (some people are less conservative and select a cutoff closer to 0.35).</p>
<p><strong>Completeness</strong> describes the percentage of the theoretically observable reflections (within given resolution limits) have been measured in the experiment. Completeness should be used to determine if there is sufficient data for refinement and/or model-building. A value greater than 90% is generally desired, while a value less than 75% is considered poor. Values in between will provide less than optimal results.</p>
<p><strong>Look for the plot of Rmerge vs Batch for all images</strong> (you will find it in the <strong>Dataset SAD</strong> =&gt; <strong>Analysis by batch</strong> section). <strong>Rmerge</strong> offers an indication of how well multiple observations of equivalent reflections agree with each other, with a low value indicating better agreement. Notice that this value is stable throughout much of the dataset, but starts to drift upwards towards the end of data collection, indicating there is likely to be radiation damage to the crystal. It is better to remove these compromised data from processing as long as we can leave ourselves with acceptable completeness. <strong>For this dataset cutting off after batch 120 is a reasonable compromise</strong>.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3.</span></code> The next step is the data reduction with <a class="reference external" href="https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.Aimless.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aimless</a>: <strong>add next job =&gt; All task =&gt; Data Processing =&gt; Merging and Scaling with Aimless</strong></p>
<p>In Aimless input omit the most radiation damaged images from processing. Choose <strong>xia2_unmerged_scaled</strong> data in <strong>Unmerged reflections</strong> section. <strong>Limit number branches to 120</strong> (type 1-120 in the <strong>Branches</strong>). Select a <strong>high resolution cut-off</strong> of <strong>1.8 Å</strong>.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4.</span></code> The next step is to make a hypothesis on crystal composition (that is, to guess the correct number of protein chains in the Asymmetric Unit). This is important for getting correct estimation of the solvent content; grossly incorrect estimate may have a significant impact on the success of Experimental Phasing. In order to specify the expected crystal composition, run the <a class="reference external" href="https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.ASUDef.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asymmetric Unit definition</a> task, which will also calculate the corresponding solvent content. <strong>add next job =&gt; All task =&gt; Asymmetric Unit and Structure Revision =&gt; Asymmetric Unit Contents</strong></p>
<p>When preparing the task for run, specify <strong>Se</strong> as <strong>Main anomalous scatterer</strong>.</p>
<p>After task finishes, inspect the <strong>verdict</strong> section in the report page. The verdict will help you to assess the likelihood of having the correct ASU composition.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">ASU composition remains a hypothesis until the structure is solved. It is not unusual to have it reconsidered in case of difficulties with phasing or refinement.</p>
</div>
<p>On output, the task creates the initial <strong>structure revision</strong>, containing only <strong>ASU definition</strong>  and <strong>merged HKL dataset</strong>.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">5.</span></code> Once the Asymmetric Unit is defined and initial structure revision is created, initial phases may be estimated. Finding initial phases in Experimental Phasing is a two-step procedure. On first step, anomalous signal in the reflection dataset is used to find location of anomalous scatterers (the heavy-atom substructure). On second step, the reflection dataset and substructure found are used to estimate protein phases.</p>
<p>The substructure is found with ShelxCD software, which may be used as part of Crank-2 automatic pipeline (see task <strong>Substructure Search with SHELX via Crank-2</strong> in the Experimental Phasing section of the Task List), or with the dedicated ShelxCD task (<strong>Substructure Search with SHELX-C/D</strong>). Let’s choose the first one: <strong>add next job =&gt; All task =&gt; Experimental phasing =&gt; Substructure Search with SHELX via Crank-2</strong>.</p>

<p>The graph <strong>Dano/Sigdano</strong> shows the anomalous signal strength as a function of resolution. The larger the <strong>Dano/Sigdano</strong> ratio, the stronger the signal, and values under 0.7 indicate a very weak signal not suitable for phasing (grey area). In our case, the anomalous signal for appears to be relatively weak but sufficient for SAD phasing.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Judging from the obtained scores, there is a reasonable chance that the substructure has been correctly determined</strong></p>
<p>A good indication that the substructure has been correctly determined is if the threshold (i.e. CFOM) has been reached before the maximum number of cycles has been performed.</p>
<p>A division of trials in the <strong>distribution of CFOM from trials</strong> graph is also an encouraging indicator: the graph shows the separation of incorrect (lower CFOM) trials from correct (higher CFOM) solutions.</p>
<p>This division can also be observed as clustering in a graph of <strong>CC against CCweak</strong> where the trials on the top right indicate correct solutions with higher values of CC and CCweak. CC should be above 25</p>
<p><strong>Estimated atom occupancies</strong> histogram chart provides vivid information according to anomalous atom occupancies from the best trial. <strong>Estimated occupancy should be higher than 0.25</strong>.</p>

<p>Please, find a <strong>verdict</strong> in Phaser output. It is an assessment of task performance quality.</p>
<p>The average <strong>FOM</strong> (figures of merit) from phasing provides a very rough initial indication of the quality of the phases: values <strong>above 0.3</strong> indicate a <strong>good quality</strong> and values <strong>below 0.15</strong> a <strong>poor quality</strong> of the phases.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">7.</span></code> The Phaser job generates two structure revisions, for original and inverse hands.

<p>The correct hand should now be identified with certainty.</p>
