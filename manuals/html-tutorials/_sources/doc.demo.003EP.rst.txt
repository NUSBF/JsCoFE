GerE: Auto-EP with Crank-2
==========================

The data are from the crystal structure of GerE, a transcription activator from Bacillus subtilis, which was solved by MAD phasing using the Se signal (V.M.A. Ducros, R.J. Lewis, C.S. Verma, E.J. Dodson, G. Leonard, J.P. Turkenburg, G.N. Murshudov, A.J. Wilkinson and J.A. Brannigan, J. Mol. Biol. (2001) 306 759-771).

The protein contains 70 amino acids including two (Se-)Met. Crystal structure has 3 dimers in the asymmetric unit. With modern software, the structure can also be easily solved by SAD phasing from just the Se peak or inflection data.

Objectives

1. To learn how to operate with CCP4 Cloud web-interface.

2. To get familiar with Crank-2, an automated pipeline for experimental phasing.


Workflow is fully defined by numbered paragraphs. Open cycles mark additional information.

Workflow

1. You have already done the first step - imported data that including sequence file and five datasets (from a single MTZ file).
to continue growing the project tree from a given job, select that job, press "+" button and select the next task from menu

2. Locate "Crank-2 Automated Experimental Phasing" task and try to open it.
Note the icon is in red frame and task name is greyed out
Click on icon to see what is missing

3. Create initial revision. This is done using task "Asymmetric Unit Contents".  Use defaults. Note which dataset was picked up.
Sequence data and one dataset are required for initial revision.
The new revision includes two initial hypotheses, the symmetry of the crystal and content of asymmetric unit.
The former hypothesis can be revised later using "Change Space Group" task, as long as the old and new space groups belong to the same point group. Otherwise you will have to start with unmerged data and run Aimless
The later hypothesis can be revised later using "Asymmetric Unit Correction". 

4. Try to open Crank-2 task.

What is missing at this point?

5. Create initial revision that will suit "Crank-2": select peak dataset and define Se as anomalous scatterer.

6. Start Crank-2 job using default selections and parameters. This will be SAD phasing. Go to (10) while the job is running.
Substructure determination section: how many Se sites with reasonable occupancy were found?
Hand determination section: is there an evidence that the anomalous substructure was determined correctly?
Model building section: was model building successful? Are there any model errors (use UglyMol and inspect blue and green maps)?

7. Run "Refinement with Refmac" starting from finished Crank-2 SAD phasing job. Use defaults.
The jobs that generate revision(s) have "Inspect" button in the "Structure Revision" section of the "Report" tab. Check which dataset is in the output Refmac revision.

8. Use "asymmetric unit correction" task to edit the revision generated with Refmac job: replace peak dataset with the native dataset.

9. Run Refmac job with the new revision.

Check which dataset is in this Refmac output revision.

10. Clone previous Crank-2 job, or open a new one branching it from asymmetric unit content job. Set it for MAD phasing with all available datasets including native. (Note there is a separate menu for Native.)
In case of SAD, there are two ways of using native dataset: use it for phasing (SIRAS) or use it for model building only. In case of MAD, such a choice is not available and native data are only used for model building.

11. Run "Refinement with Refmac" after MAD Crank-2 job selecting revision corresponding to native dataset.

Which Refmac run gave better refinement statistics and why?

12. Continue the best Refmac job with the "Prepare data for deposition" job.

Is the structure good enough for deposition?

In a real project you would continue the best Refmac job with "Model Building with Coot" and then continue iterating Refmac and Coot (see Refinement tutorial part 3).
