The multi-domain Molecular Replacement
======================================

This tutorial explains how to use separate domains as a search model for Molecular Replacement (MR). For this tutorial, we'll use Sucrose-Phosphatase (SPP) from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 in a closed conformation (PDB Entry - 1TJ3).

``1.``	 All data required for this tutorial were already imported into the project. Please look at the import's task output.

``2.``	The next step is to define the **Asymmetric Unit content**: click **add task => go to All tasks => Asymmetric Unit and Structure revision => Asymmetric Unit Contents.** Run the task or type *Asymmetric Unit Contents* in the search bar in the **A-Z tab**.

After the task is finished, please, investigate the output it created. Every task in CCP4 Cloud produces a report. Here we can see that Matthew's coefficient suggests that there is one molecule in the asymmetric unit and solvent % is within the usual range for macromolecular crystals, diffracting at a similar resolution.

.. tip::
        Please read the verdicts carefully, it helps assess the obtained results. 

``3.``	Once **Asymmetric Unit Contents** is defined with acceptable scores (solvent content, Matthews probability and expected stoichiometry), start the **Prepare Single-Chain MR Model(s) from Coordinate data** task: **add next job => All tasks => Molecular Replacement => Prepare Single-Chain MR Model(s) from Coordinate data**

Choose ``[0001-02] 1s2oA_dom1`` as **Coordinates (1)** and ``[0001-03] 1s2oA_dom2`` as **Coordinates (2)** and run the task. And two Single-Chain MR models will be prepared.

``4.`` Created models can be further used in both `Phaser <../html-taskref/doc.task.Phaser.html>`_ and `Molrep <../html-taskref/doc.task.Molrep.html>`_ tasks.

``4a.`` Use Phaser for Molecular replacement in this tutorial: **add next job => All tasks => Molecular Replacement => Molecular Replacement with Phaser**

Select ``[0003-01] 1s2oA_dom1_A.mrep`` as **Model ensemble (1)** and ``[0003-02] 1s2oA_dom2_A.mrep`` as **Model ensemble (2)** and click run. Phaser will search ensemble 1 first and then ensemble 2.

``4b.`` Use Molrep for Molecular replacement in this tutorial: **add next job => All tasks => Molecular Replacement => Molecular Replacement with Molrep**

Run Molrep with ``[0003-01] 1s2oA_dom1_A.mrep`` as **Model ensemble** first.

After it finished append another Molrep task with ``[0003-02] 1s2oA_dom2_A.mrep`` as **Model ensemble**.

``5.``  After MR solution was found, the positioned model should be rebuilt in order to match the target sequence more closely. This can be conveniently done using one of CCP4's automatic model builders (`ModelCraft <../html-taskref/doc.task.ModelCraft.html>`_ , `Buccaneer <../html-taskref/doc.task.Buccaneer.html>`_, `Arp/wArp <../html-taskref/doc.task.ArpWarp.html>`_ , `CCP4Build <../html-taskref/doc.task.CCP4Build.html>`_). Let's run the `ModelCraft <../html-taskref/doc.task.ModelCraft.html>`_ task. The built model can be visually inspected with **UglyMol** (the corresponding launch button can be found on the task report page).

``6.`` Compare Modelcraft outputs after Phaser and Molrep with `Gesamt <../html-taskref/doc.task.Gesamt.html>`_ (use multiple selections to access the data from different branches):

**Select both models => add next job => All tasks =>  Toolbox => Pairwise Structural Alignment with GESAMT**

``7.`` Further refinement can be conveniently done with the **Automated refinement and ligand fitting workflow**
