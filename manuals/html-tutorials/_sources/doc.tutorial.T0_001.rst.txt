====================
Work with CCP4 Cloud
====================

This tutorial is designed to describe how to start a project and load the data in CCP4 Cloud.

The `CCP4 Cloud <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/>`_ account should be created or/and CCP4 Software Suite version 7.1 and above must be installed (download `here <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/download/>`_).

Starting a Project
------------------

In CCP4 Cloud, work is arranged in `Projects <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-userguide/jscofe_myprojects.html>`_.

Press |addjob| button in the button line above the list, and create your first project. You will need to specify a short project name, and a more descriptive title in the dialog appeared.

The CCP4 Cloud provides 3 projects initialisation modes:

++++++++++++++
Autostart mode

Autostart mode is designed for starting with one of `automatic workflows <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/Workflows.html>`_ featuring structure solution scenarios in CCP4 Cloud, and optimised list of essential tasks for structure completion which can be switched to the full list at any point.

Once added the Cloud will provide you a choice of the project templates:

    #. Automatic Molecular Replacement with MrBump or MoRDa

    #. Molecular Replacement with AlphaFold Model
    
    #. Simple Molecular Replacement with Search Model

    #. Automated Experimental Phasing with Crank-2

    #. Dimple Refinement and Ligand Fitting

After the template was picked the workflow would ask you to upload the data. You may choose **CCP4 Cloud storage** in **Import data from** if you have no data, yet want to practice working in the Cloud.

Standard mode

Standard mode is designed for operating all CCP4 Cloud tasks manually, with access to the full `task list <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-userguide/jscofe_tasklist.html>`_ by default. The Cloud learns your preferences and suggests tasks as it accumulates knowledge about your habits. Those tasks will show up in the Suggested task tab

Cloud has several `data import <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/Data_Import.html>`__ tasks:

.. image:: images/T0_001_data_import.png

#. `Data import <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.Import.html>`__ 

#. `Import Sequence(s) by Copy-Paste <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.ImportSeqCP.html>`_

#. `Import from PDB <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.ImportPDB.html>`_

#. `Import from Cloud Storage <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.CloudImport.html>`_

#. `Import & Replace <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.ImportReplace.html>`_

#. `Hop on CCP4 Cloud <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.Migrate.html>`_


+++++++++++
Hop On mode 
+++++++++++


Hop On mode is designed for a quick start from a phased (possibly partially built and refined) structure or heavy-atom substructure, for further refinement and model building, with the optimised list of essential tasks for structure completion (can be switched to the full list). 

It will direct you to `Hop on task <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.Migrate.html>`_ there you are expected to provide reflection data, phases, atomic coordinates and ligand description if you have any.

CCP4 Cloud tutorials
--------------------

Tutorials include examples designed to demonstrate structure solution techniques in CCP4 Cloud. Tutorials are presented as seed projects with pre-loaded data, which can be imported into the account. Each tutorial has instructions that will guide you through the required project development stages.
