Structure prediction for Molecular Replacement
==============================================

`AlphaFold2 <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2>`_ and `RoseTTAFold <https://robetta.bakerlab.org/>`_ predicted models are widely acknowledged as good structure templates for Molecular Replacement (MR). This tutorial explains how to use predicted models as a search model for Molecular Replacement (MR). For this tutorial, we'll use Sucrose-Phosphatase (SPP) from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 in a closed conformation (PDB Entry - 1TJ3).

``1.``	 All data required for this tutorial were already imported into the project. Please look at the import's task output.

``2.`` For obtaining the predicted model we will use CCP4 Cloud's `Structure Prediction <../html-taskref/doc.task.StructurePrediction.html>`_ task, which uses AlphaFold-2 (in `Openfold <https://colab.research.google.com/github/aqlaboratory/openfold/blob/main/notebooks/OpenFold.ipynb>`_  or `ColabFold <https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb>`_ implementation) for generating structure models from the given sequence: click **add task => go to All tasks => Structure Prediction => Structure Prediction**

``3.``	The next step is to define the **Asymmetric Unit content**: click **add task => go to All tasks => Asymmetric Unit and Structure revision => Asymmetric Unit Contents.** Run the task or type *Asymmetric Unit Contents* in the search bar in the **A-Z tab**.
After the task is finished, please, investigate the output it created. Every task in CCP4 Cloud produces a report. Here we can see that Matthew's coefficient suggests that there is one molecule in the asymmetric unit and solvent % is within the usual range for macromolecular crystals, diffracting at a similar resolution.

.. tip::
        Please read the verdicts carefully, it helps assess the obtained results. 

``4.`` Once the model is obtained start the `Prepare Single-Chain MR Model(s) from Coordinate data <../html-taskref/doc.task.ModelPrepXYZ.html>`_ task: **add next job => All tasks => Molecular Replacement => Prepare Single-Chain MR Model(s) from Coordinate data**.
This task prepares Single-Chain MR search model(s) for further use in molecular replacement programs (`Phaser <../html-taskref/doc.task.Phaser.html>`__ and `Molrep <../html-taskref/doc.task.Molrep.html>`__). We are going to modify (prune) coordinates in order to remove parts that do not correspond to the target sequence using **Molrep** modification protocol. 

``5``. Created model can be further used in both `Phaser <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.Phaser.html>`__ and `Molrep <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.Molrep.html>`__ tasks.

    We will use Phaser for Molecular replacement in this tutorial: **add next job => All task => Molecular Replacement => Molecular Replacement with Phaser**

``6.`` Predicted models usually have a very high sequence similarity with the target structure: 100% if a structure was generated from the given sequence, and very close to 100% if the structure was obtained from AFDB. Nevertheless, structure rebuilding with `Modelcraft <../html-taskref/doc.task.Modelcraft.html>`__, `CCP4 Build <../html-taskref/doc.task.CCP4Build.html>`_, `Buccaneer <../html-taskref/doc.task.Buccaneer.html>`_ or `Arp/wArp <../html-taskref/doc.task.ArpWArp.html>`_ is usually required after phasing because parts of the model are often removed at model preparation stage due to the low confidence score (equivalent to high B-factors). 

Let's run the `ModelCraft <../html-taskref/doc.task.ModelCraft.html>`__ task. 

Once the task is finished, the built model can be visually inspected with **UglyMol** (the corresponding launch button can be found on the task report page).

``7.`` Further refinement can be conveniently done with the **Automated refinement and ligand fitting workflow**
