Using PISA in CCP4 Cloud
========================

Maria Fando

PISA requires only atomic coordinates of sufficiently well refined structures. If they are obtained in course of crystallographic project,
use structure revision just before the ``Deposition`` task. Alternatively, PISA may be used on any data in just two steps: 

``1.`` Import coordinate data; any valid PDB or mmCIF-formatted file may be used. In order to import the file, click **add task** => **All tasks** => **Data import** => the job chosen from the list of tasks will open automatically

         :scale: 40 %
         :align: center 

From the above list, suitable import tasks include ``File(s) Upload and Import``, ``Import from PDB`` and ``Import from Cloud Stirage``. In order to read more about an import task, click on task documentation button |reference|, found on top of the corresponding Job Dialog.

.. Warning::
            Do not use PISA if your structure is not yet complete and ready for PDB deposition, because even a small imperfectness in crystal contacts may make the difference between identifying an interface as binding or not.

``2.`` Start PISA, as the next (child) job, by clicking **add task** => **All tasks** => **Validation, Analysis and Deposition** => **Surface, Interfaces and Assembly Analysis with PISA**

PISA is fairly automatic, and does not have any input parameters to be set. The **ligand processing mode** in **Advanced paeameters** should be always set to *Auto* (default). In rare cases, when crystal contains too many ligand molecules, them may be declared *Fixed* to macromolecules in order to keep the problem computationally tractable. *Free* ligand processing mode forces ligands to be always treated as independent entities and is for expert use only.
