Creating Molecular Replacement Search Ensembles with CCP4MG/MrBUMP
==================================================================

This tutorial explains how to create the ensembles for Molecular Replacement with `CCP4mg <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/MG/>`_ graphical interface. We will use the Gamma tutorial example for the demonstration.

  .. important::
             Launch CCP4 Cloud through the local installation of CCP4 on your computer |ccp4cloud_remote|.

``1.``	 The sequence data and reflection data were already imported to the “Creating Molecular Replacement Search Ensembles with CCP4MG/MrBUMP” project (*import from the Cloud storage task*).

``2.``	The next step is to define **Asymmetric Unit content**: click **add task => go to All task => Asymmetric Unit and Structure revision => Asymmetric Unit Contents.** Run the task.

``3.``	Once **Asymmetric Unit Contents** is defined and we are satisfied with result. It is possible to start the **MR Ensemble with CCP4mg** task: **add next job => All task => Molecular Replacement => Prepare MR Ensemble with CCP4mg**

``4.``	`Prepare MR Ensemble with CCP4mg <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.EnsemblePrepMG.html>`_ task will identify homologues from the `PDB <https://www.rcsb.org/>`_ and the `EBI-AFDB <https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk>`_ and display them in CCP4mg (``takes a couple of minutes``).

For :abbr:`AFDB (AlphaFold DataBase)` models, you can adjust the pLDDT cut-off

.. toggle-header::
       :header:  **pLDDT cut-off**
                
                AlphaFold produces a per-residue estimate of its confidence score, called **pLDDT** on a scale from 0 - 100. This option sets the minimum level of **pLDDT** of selected residues.
                
                * **pLDDT > 90**: residues are expected to be positioned with a high accuracy. These models should be suitable for any application that benefits from high accuracy (e.g. characterising binding sites).
                
                * **70 < pLDDT < 90** residues are expected to be positioned reasonably well (generally, a good backbone prediction).
                
                * **50 < pLDDT < 70** corresponds to residues modelled with low confidence, which should be treated with caution.
                
                * **pLDDT < 50** indicates residues that should not be interpreted. Such scores are a reasonably strong predictor of disorder, i.e. they suggest that the region is either unstructured in physiological conditions, or gets structured only as part of a complex.

Higher values mean only the most confidently predicted residues are retained in the search models.


.. Note::
        It is possible to search only the PDB or EBI-AFDB by unticking the relevant box in the input menu.

For this tutorial, make sure that:

    •	**PDB sequence redundancy level** set to **100%**

    •	**Include structures from AFDB** set **on**

    •	**EBI-AFDB pLDDT cut-off** set to **50%**

    •	**Maximum number of models to create** is **10**

``5.``	Once the task is run, the **CCP4mg window** will opened on your computer. After a couple of minutes, the results of the MrBUMP sequence-based search should appear in the graphical interface.

  .. Note::
       the models will have been truncated to better match the target structure by referencing the sequence alignment between the model and the target. The `Sculptor <https://doi.org/10.1107/S0907444910051218>`_ application is used to perform the truncation. The resulting search models are structurally aligned.

``6.``	In order to save all that is currently visible in CCP4mg and make it an “ensemble model” go to the **File => Save all visible to the CCP4 Cloud**

  .. tip::
    To save a single model or chosen models, make all other models invisible. To do this in CCP4mg, right-click (or Ctrl-click / Cmd-click on a laptop) on the coloured icon next to the model’s name in the “Display Table” (right-hand panel of CCP4MG window). The icon turns grey and the model becomes invisible in the graphics window. Right-clicking again makes the model visible again.


``7.``	Quit CCP4mg

    The created ensemble should appear in the task output window.

``8.``	Created ensembles can be further used in both `Phaser <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.Phaser.html>`_ and `Molrep <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.Molrep.html>`_ tasks.

    We will use the Phaser for Molecular replacement in this tutorial: **add next job => All task => Molecular Replacement => Molecular Replacement with Phaser**


    For predicted models we recommend setting **Similarity to target by rms differences (Å) to 1.2**

``9.``  After Phaser, model should be rebuilt to match the target sequence more closely using one of the model building tools presen (`Buccaneer <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.Buccaneer.html>`_, `Arp/wArp <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.ArpWarp.html>`_ , `CCP4Build <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.CCP4Build.html>`_). Let's run the `CCP4Build <https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk/manuals/html-taskref/doc.task.CCP4Build.html>`_ task for this project. The builded model can be inspected in **UglyMol** window in the task output.

``10.``	 Further refinement can be done by **Automated refinement and ligand fitting workflow**
