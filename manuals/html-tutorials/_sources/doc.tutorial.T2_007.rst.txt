Molecular Replacement
=====================

1. **Import the tutorial data**:
  - Use the “Import from Cloud” option in “Data import”.
  - Select “Workshops” -> “Seacoast 2024” -> “mr example 1”.
  - Select all of the files using the Shift key. The import includes sequence, mtz (reflection data), and an Alphafold prediction for the unknown target.
  - Examine the summary from the import. Find the reflection data details such as spacegroup and resolution. Also, find the XYZ coordinates section for the Alphafold model and view the model in the “Uglymol” viewer.

2. **Determine the contents of the asymmetric unit**:
  - Add the “Asymmetric unit contents” task.
  - Run the task using default options. The result should be a prediction of 1 copy in the asymmetric unit with a high probability score.

3. **Prepare the Alphafold prediction as a search model for MR**:
  - Use the “Split MR model with SliceNDice” task from the MR model preparation menu.
  - Set the number of splits to 1. This option allows for splitting a model into domains, but in this case, there is only 1 clear domain.
  - The task will also convert residue pLDDT scores to B-factors and remove residues that score less than the pLDDT threshold of 70.
  - After running the preparation task, compare the search model before and after the process in Coot by adding a Coot task and loading both the original and modified Alphafold models.

4. **Run Molecular Replacement (MR)**:
  - Add a Phaser task from the “MR solvers menu”.
  - All the data and model are provided to Phaser automatically.
  - Run the task and view the output report. Examine the increase in the LLG score as each step is taken (rotation function, translation function, refinement steps). We expect the LLG to rise each time with the final refined LLG being greater than 60 for a good solution. A translation function Z-score (TFZ) of greater than 8 is also indicative of a good solution.

5. **Refinement**:
  - Follow the Phaser task with refinement using the “Refmacat” task from the “Refinement” menu.
  - Use many cycles (200) of the “jelly-body” refinement option under the “Restraints” section.
  - Watch the R/Rfree values decline to a steady state over many cycles. The final R/Rfree values should be in the range 0.2->0.3.

6. **View and improve the model**:
  - View the resulting model and map in Uglymol or Coot.
  - Look for clear evidence in the difference map of parts of the model that don’t match the data. This could be positive difference density (green) for incorrect side chains or parts of the main chain that need building or water molecules that have not been added.
  - Improve the model through iterative cycles of manual model building in Coot and refinement in Refmacat.
