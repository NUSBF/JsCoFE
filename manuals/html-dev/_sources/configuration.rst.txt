CCP4 Cloud Configuration
========================

----------------------------
Configuration file structure
----------------------------

CCP4 Cloud Configuration File is a json document with the following components: ::

  {
    "FrontEnd" : { ........... },
    "FEProxy"  : { ........... },
    "NumberCrunchers" : [
        { .............. },
        { .............. },
        .....
        { .............. }
    ],
    "Emailer" : { ............ }
  }

Not all components are required for all servers.

*Front End Server*  requires ``"FrontEnd"``, all ``"NumberCrunchers"`` and
``"Emailer"``.

*Front End Proxy Server* requires ``"FrontEnd"``, ``"FEProxy"`` and one item
of ``"NumberCrunchers"`` list, which relates to (optional) client server.

*Number Cruncher Server* requires only one item of ```"NumberCrunchers"``
list, which relates to that server.

A single configuration file with description of all Cloud components, may be
used for all servers in the setup. However, maintenance of individual number
crunchers (in particular, client-side servers, or *CCP4 Cloud Clients*) may be
more convenient if their configuration files do not contain items related to
other components.


-------------------------------------
Configuration of the Front End Server
-------------------------------------

Front End Server configuration has the following structure: ::

  "FrontEnd" : {
    "description"      : {
      "id"   : "ccp4",
      "name" : "CCP4-Harwell",

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FE Server Configuration Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**"description"**

    This is an optional object with the following items: ::
    
        "description" : {
            "id"   : "ccp4",
            "name" : "CCP4-Harwell",
            "icon" : "images_com/ccp4-harwell.png"
        }
    
    which gives global identification to a particular CCP4 Cloud setup (instance).
    Parameters:
    
        *"id"*
           Unix-type id, which must be globally unique. This id allows for
           discrimination between CCP4 Cloud setups in different geographic locations.
           The id is used internally and is not exposed to end user.
        
        *"name"*
           Arbitrary name of CCP4 Cloud instance, which is used for reporting
           to end users. The name may contain HTML formatting
        
        *"icon"*
           Path to icon associated with CCP4 Cloud instance. Both absolute
           and relative paths may be used. Relative path originates from ``jscofe``
           directory (the current directory for setver's *node* process).


**"protocol", "host", "port"**

    These are mandatory items. Typically, all CCP4 Cloud Servers listen to
    localhost ports, which may receive
    external requests through redirection from Apache or any other web-server
    of choice. Therefore values other than: ::
    
        "protocol" : "http"
        "host"     : "localhost"
        
    should not be used other than for development purposes. ::
    
        "port" : 8081
    
    should be chosen separately for each configured server from the
    appropriate range of available port numbers
      

**"externalURL"**

    This is the URL, under which the server is visible to the outside world.
    If left blank, its value will be calculated as
    ``protocol://host:port``. However, when chosen port receives redirection
    from Apache, *"externalURL"* should be set to address used for redirection,
    e.g., ::
    
        "externalURL" : "https://my.web.server.com/ccp4cloud"


**"reportURL"**

    This optional item specifies server's URL for reporting to end user in the login
    page and a few other places. The purpose of this item is to indicate real Front 
    End URL to user when FE Server is accessed via Front End Proxy (FE Proxy runs 
    on local host, therefore, web-address in user's browser will be always
    ``"http://localhost:port"`` even if data is sent over to remote server. In such
    situations, specification of *"reportURL"* allows to inform the user of the actual 
    connection address: ::
    
        "reportURL" : "https://my.web.server.com/ccp4cloud"


**"exclusive"**

    Specifies whether *"port"* is exclusively allocated to the server or not. There
    are few reasons to use value other than ::
    
        "exclusive" : true


**"stoppable"**

    Specifies whether the server may be stopped by user by executing server's URL
    with */stop* appended to it, in browser. This is a developer's option, and 
    there is no reason to use value other than ::
    
        "stoppable" : false
        
    in production systems.


**"rejectUnauthorized"** 

    Switches on/off (true/false) the verification of SSL certificates. This should be set 
    ``true`` by default. Switching the verification off may be used for debugging purposes 
    or in case when site should be maintained even at risk while SSL certificates are being 
    sorted. Note that this option is specific to server, not all Cloud setup.


**"exclude_tasks"**

    Optional list of tasks that can be excluded from the list of available tasks.
    The tasks are specified by the names of the corresponding JavaScript task
    classes, for example, ::
    
        "exclude_tasks" : ["TaskAmple","TaskBalbes"]
    
    Task classes are collected in js-common/tasks source code directory.


**"fsmount"**

    File system mount common for communicating servers (Front End and Number 
    Cruncher). Configuration: :: 
    
        "fsmount" : null
        
    causes all data to be transmitted solely via http(s), even within localhost.
    If a common file mount is specified, e.g., ::
    
        "fsmount" : "/"
        
    then data are transmitted using direct file copy, and only metadata is 
    exchanged via http(s).


**"localSetup"**

    This optional configuration overrides automatic identification of local and 
    remote setups. Local setup is one with all servers running on the same 
    hardware host, which is identified by using localhosts for communication. 
    In few particular cases, such identification may fail, which may be 
    corrected by using ::
    
        "localSetup" : false
        

**"update_rcode"**

    Optional code (1-255) which is returned when administrators requests update 
    of servers by pressing *"Update"* button in *Administrator Page*, tab *Nodes*.
    See launcher script for further details. Example: ::
    
        "update_rcode" : 212
        

**"userDataPath"**

    Path to directory, which will keep user metadata. Usually, no more than a
    few KBytes of data per user should be stored. Both absolute and relative 
    paths can be used. Relative path is calculated from directory containing 
    *jscofe* codes: *js-client*, *js-common*, *js-server*, *pycofe* and others.
    The directory must exist before starting server for first time, or server
    will not start.
    

**"storage"**

    Path to directory to keep various data files such as logs, usage stats etc.
    The directory must exist before starting server for first time, or server
    will not start.
    

**"projectsPath"**

    Description of file system area allocated for users' projects and data.
    In simplest case, it may be just a path to a directory on a file system 
    with sufficient disk space (estimated as number of users times user's 
    disk quota, see *"ration"* configuration below). Also in this case,
    *"storage"* configuration may be omitted. However, this type of
    description is deprecated and should not be used.
    
    In all new setups, *"projectsPath"* should be configured as the following 
    object: ::
    
        "projectsPath" : {
            "fs01" : { "path"        : "/path01",
                       "type"        : "volume",
                       "diskReserve" : 10000,
                       "dirName"     : "ccp4cloud_projects"
                     },
            "fs02" : { "path"        : "/path02",
                       "type"        : "volume",
                       "diskReserve" : 10000,
                       "dirName"     : "ccp4cloud_projects"
                     },
            . . . . . . . . 
            "fsNN" : { "path"        : "/pathNN",
                       "type"        : "volume",
                       "diskReserve" : 10000,
                       "dirName"     : "ccp4cloud_projects"
                     }
        }
    
    This configuration allows to place user projects on several file systems
    (disks), which is useful if users' data does not fit single file system.
    
    Here,
    
        *"fsXX"*
            is an arbitrary chosen identifier for file system; at least 
            one file system should be configured in the object.
        
        *"path"*
            is path to projects directory on related file system
    
        *"type"*
            is file system type. Two options are available:
    
                *"volume"* : means ordinary system, projects will be placed in path given
    
                *"home"* : indicates that projects are placed in user's home directories;
                in this, case, the actual directory path is calculated as 
                ``/path/login/dirName`` (must exist) where ``login`` is user's login name,
                and ``dirName`` is given below
    
        *"diskReserve"*
            (MBytes) specifies free disk space threshold; if free disk space
            falls below this value, new user projects will not be allocated on
            the related file system
    
        *"dirName"*
            specifies custom directory name for *"home"* type of 
            file systems (ignored for *"volume"* type)

    
**"jobs_safe"**

Description of a safe for failed jobs. Users may choose a type of feedback
agreement, including retention of failed jobs, along with input data, in
CP4 Cloud safe for further investigation by developers. The safe is a directory
in file system shared between the Front End and *all* Number Crunchers. Safe 
description is the following object: ::

    "jobs_safe" : {
        "path" : "/path/to/jobs/safe",
        "capacity" : 10
    }

Here,

    *"path"*
        should point to safe directory as it is seen on the Front End server
    
    *"capacity"*
        is the maximum number of failed jobs of particular type that is retained
        in the safe (so that only last ``capacity`` jobs will be available for
        investigation)


**"facilitiesPath"**

    Path to directory to keep cache of files obtained from facilities like 
    external file servers, synchrotrons and similar. The directory must exist
    before starting server for first time, or server will not start.


**"ICAT_wdsl"**

    URL of the WDSL service of STFC/SCD iCAT facility: :: 

        "https://icat02.diamond.ac.uk/ICATService/ICAT?wsdl"


**"ICAT_ids"**

    URL of the IDS service of STFC/SCD iCAT facility: :: 

        "https://ids01.diamond.ac.uk/ids"


**"auth_software"**

    This is an optional item, which may be null or missing if not used.
    Otherwise, the item provides description of 3rd-party software, use of 
    which requires user authorisation. The item represents an object with
    the following structure: ::

        "auth_software"    : {
            "arpwarp" : {
                "desc_software" : "Arp/wArp Model Building Software from EMBL-Hamburg",
                "icon_software" : "task_arpwarp",
                "desc_provider" : "EMBL Outstation in Hamburg",
                "icon_provider" : "org_emblhamburg",
                "auth_url"      : "https://arpwarp.embl-hamburg.de/api/maketoken/?reqid=$reqid&addr=1.2.3.4&cburl=$cburl"
            },
            "gphl-buster"  : {
                "desc_software" : "Global Phasing Limited Software Suite",
                "icon_software" : "task_buster",
                "desc_provider" : "Global Phasing Limited",
                "icon_provider" : "org_gphl",
                "auth_url"      : "https://arpwarp.embl-hamburg.de/api/maketoken/?reqid=$reqid&addr=1.2.3.4&cburl=$cburl"
            }
        }
        
    In the above example, keys "arpwarp" and "gphl-buster" are authorisation
    Ids, defined in the corresponding task classes. "auth_url" are URLs of
    authorisation servers. Parameter part of these URLs, which follows after
    question mark, are chosen on agreement with developers of respective 
    authorisation servers.
    
    Configuration of authorisation software results in the appearance of the
    corresponding entry in user account settings, available in "My Account" 
    page. In that section, a user can request authorisation to use software 
    from the software provider. Upon request, user is redirected to the
    authorisation server web-page with license agreement and other
    information, collected by the provider. After completion of the
    authorisation request, user is redirected back to CCP4 Cloud, and the
    corresponding authorisation record is added in user's account
    automatically. This record enables task, which use authorised software,
    for the user.
        

**"bootstrapHTML"**
 
    Path (relative or absolute) to HTML bootstrap file: ::
    
        "bootstrap/jscofe.html"
    
    Alternative bootstrap files can be used for debug purposes or quick change 
    of source code directories.
 
 
**"maxRestarts"**
 
    CCP4 Cloud Front End can automatically restart after certain type of 
    errors. This parameter limits the maximal number of restarts in order 
    to avoid infinite restart loops.
 
 
**"fileCapSize"**
 
    Limit size of log file of *running* jobs delivered to client device, in
    bytes. If log file exceed this limit, extra content is removed from the 
    middle of the file. Log files of *finished* jobs are delivered to client
    device full, without modifications, irrespective of their size.
 
 
**"regMode"**
 
    User registration mode. Configuration ::
    
        "regMode" : "admin"
        
    specifies administrative registration mode, when a new user can be registered
    only by server admin (a user with administrative privileges).
    Configuration ::
    
        "regMode" : "email"
        
    allows users to register themselves, in addition to registration by admin.
    In all cases, users are sent temporary password by e-mail.


**"sessionCheckPeriod"**

    Time period, in milliseconds, for checking session status and connection
    between user device and the Front-End server. This period should be
    reasonably short such that duplicate sessions are forced to close before
    a user performs any action (CCP4 Cloud does not support multiple logins);
    2000 ms is a reasonable value.


**"ration"**

    This configuration object sets default quotas for new users: ::

        "ration" : {
            "storage"   : 10000,
            "cpu_day"   : 24,
            "cpu_month" : 240
        }
        
    where 

        *"storage"*
            is disk quota, in MBytes
        
        *"cpu_day"*
            is CPU quota per day, in hours 

        *"cpu_month"*
            is CPU quota per month, in hours
        
    A user is able to submit new jobs if their projects occupy not more than 
    given *storage* quota, provided that the have not spent more than 
    given *cpu_day* CPU-hours in last 24-hour time period and not more than
    given *cpu_month* CPU-hours in last 30-day time period.
    
    User quotas may be adjusted individually by users with administrative 
    privileges via CCP4 Cloud Administration Facility.


**"cloud_mounts"**

    This optional configuration object specify directories on Front End server,
    available to users for reading, for example: ::
 
        "cloud_mounts" : {
            "My Computer"    : "/",
            "Home"           : ["$HOME","$USERPROFILE"],
            "CCP4 examples"  : "$CCP4/share/ccp4i2/demo_data",
            "Demo projects"  : "./demo-projects",
            "My files"       : "./$LOGIN/files"
        }
        
    Mount *"Demo projects"* is reserved for keeping CCP4 Cloud Demo Projects, 
    which can be imported by using the *Demo projects* button found above
    user's List of Projects. Other mounts can be used in dedicated import 
    task (*Cloud Import*) and in few tasks that use direct access to local and 
    Cloud-based directories (e.g. *Xia-2* may process images from a directory 
    mounted in this way). Cloud mount names may be chosen arbitrarily; the
    appearance of words *"My"*, *"Home"*, *"CCP4"* in mount name will
    decorate the mount with the corresponding icon in Cloud File Browser.
    
    Directory paths may be both absolute and relative, and they may contain 
    environmental variables as in the above example. Variable ``$LOGIN`` will 
    be replaced with user's Cloud login name, which may be used for
    cloud storage mapping on per-user basis. When a list of paths is given
    (*cf.* above example), the first existing path from the list will be 
    mounted.


**"logflow"**

    This is optional item, which control automatic renumbering of FE log
    files. FE server writes ``stderr`` and ``stdout`` log files, with names 
    given in FE launch script. This files may grow uncomfortably large, and,
    ideally, should be split in manageable chunks for long-term bookkeeping.
    This may be achieved using the following configuration object: ::

        "logflow" : {
            "chunk_length" : 10000,
            "log_file"     : "/path/to/node_fe"
        }
        
    where

        *"log_file"*
            is template path to log files. For example, template ``/path/to/npde_fe``
            means that launch script defines log files with paths 
            ``/path/to/node_fe.log`` and ``/path/to/node_fe.err``
    
        *"chunk_length"*
            is the number of job launch records in a chunk. When specified number
            of jobs is launched, current log files are renamed as
            ``/path/to/node_fe.NN.log`` and ``/path/to/node_fe.NN.err``, where
            ``NN`` is chunk number, and new log files with template names are
            initialised

Configuration of the Client Proxy Server
----------------------------------------


Client Proxy Server configuration has the following structure: ::


  "FEProxy" : {  // optional proxy configuration
    "protocol"         : "http",
    "host"             : "localhost",
    "port"             : 8082,
    "externalURL"      : "http://localhost:8082",
    "exclusive"        : true,
    "stoppable"        : false,
    "rejectUnauthorized" : true, // optional; use only for debugging, see below
    "localisation"     : 1  // 0: all files are taken from remote server
                            // 1: images are taken from local setup
                            // 2: images and js libraries are taken from local setup
                            // 3: images and all js codes are taken from local setup
  }

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Client Proxy Server Configuration Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**"protocol", "host", "port"**

    These are mandatory items. Client Proxy server always runs on localhost,
    therefore, values other than: ::
    
        "protocol" : "http"
        "host"     : "localhost"
        
    should not be used other than for development purposes. ::
    
        "port" : 8082
    
    should be chosen separately from the appropriate range of available port
    numbers
      

**"externalURL"**

    This is the URL, under which the Client Proxy server is visible to the
    browser and Client Server (local Number Cruncher). If left blank, its
    value will be calculated as ``protocol://host:port``. Values other than
    this should not be used other than for development purposes::
    
        "externalURL" : "http://localhost:8082"
        

**"exclusive"**

    Specifies whether *"port"* is exclusively allocated to the server or not.
    There are few reasons to use value other than ::
    
        "exclusive" : true


**"stoppable"**

    Specifies whether the server may be stopped by user by executing server's URL
    with */stop* appended to it, in browser. This is a developer's option, and 
    there is no reason to use value other than ::
    
        "stoppable" : false
        
    in production systems.


**"localisation"**

    Client Proxy Server may be configured to read certain CCP4 Cloud source
    files from local CCP4 setup, rather than load them from remote server.
    This makes the system more responsive, but could potentially lead to
    visualisation defects in case of version mismatch between local and 
    remote CCP4 setups.
    
        *"localisation" : 0*
            all source files are obtained from remote server
    
        *"localisation" : 1*
            image files, icons and documentation, are
            obtained from local CCP4 setup. This is the recommended option
    
        *"localisation" : 2*
            image files, icons, documentation, and standard JavaScript
            libraries are obtained from local CCP4 setup
    
        *"localisation" : 3*
            all CCP4 Cloud source files are obtained from local CCP4 setup
        


**"rejectUnauthorized"** 

    Switches on/off (true/false) the verification of SSL certificates. This should be set 
    ``true`` by default. Switching the verification off may be used for debugging purposes 
    or in case when site should be maintained even at risk while SSL certificates are being 
    sorted. Note that this option is specific to server, not all Cloud setup.
