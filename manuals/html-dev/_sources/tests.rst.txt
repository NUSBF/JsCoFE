========================
Software testing in CCP4
========================

CCP4 command line tests contains **unix scripts** and **pytest** tests.

------------
Unix scripts 
------------

* $CEXAM/unix/runnable: 
        unix scripts using the rnase/toxd data which should actually run

* $CEXAM/unix/non-runnable: 
        unix scripts without usable input data, e.g. for image processing and data reduction

------
Pytest
------

Pytests are designed using the Arrange-Act-Assert model:

1. **Arrange**, or set up, the conditions for the test

2. **Act** by calling function or method

3. **Assert** that end condition is true

4. **Cleanup** after itself, so other tests aren’t being accidentally influenced by it

All changes and new tests should be committed to ``http://fg.oisin.rc-harwell.ac.uk/anonscm/bzr/examples/trunk``

The transition from "trunk" to "series" is performed by Charles Ballard and must be requested.

Testsys ($CCP4/examples/pytest/testsys/) require additional located in ``data test_data.tar.gz``

Testsys data also shall be available for download::

    # Downloading data for Pavol's test-sys tests (will run from $CEXAM/pytest/)
    wget http://devtools.fg.oisin.rc-harwell.ac.uk/files/test_data/test_data.tar.gz
    tar zxvf test_data.tar.gz
    ccp4-python -m pytest $CEXAM/pytest/ --junit-xml runallTest.xml

Can be run:

*  Locally
    **CCP4 console** => ``ccp4-python -m pytest ./path/to/tests``

*  Nightly on `Jenkins <https://anvil.softeng-support.ac.uk/jenkins/job/CCP4/>`_

Groovy scripts for Jenkins can be found `here <https://gitlab.stfc.ac.uk/ccb63/ccp4-groovy/-/tree/master/vars>`_

**testCCP4.groovy** runs nightly, **testCCP4Exhaustive.groovy** runs weekly (longer)

.. attention:: Groovy scripts have Mac/Linux and Windows parts, all changes should be duplicated

In order to get emails after tests run all emails should be listed in **emailNotification.groovy**

+++++++++++++++++++++++
Test new build manually 
+++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Download build from Jenkins => build (for example, Series 8.0 python3 pyside2 on windows (msvc/intel) => Build # or name => Build Artifacts

#. Run **postinstall.bat** (Windows) or **BINARY.setup** (Mac/Linux)

#. Open build console

#. Run **ccp4.setup.bat** (Windows) or **$CCP4/bin/ccp4.setup-sh** (Mac/Linux)

#. ccp4-python -m pytest ./path/to/tests

.. attention:: Do NOT forget to install SHELX and add the data folder for testsys

================
CCP4 Cloud tests
================

Performed using `Selenium WebDriver <https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/>`_

Tests can be found in ``jsCoFE/setests``

 **Before running the tests**

   - Tests require Selenium and PyTest installed. Please do ::

        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python -m pip install selenium
        python -m pip install pytest

   - If you would like to generate local HTML reports, please also install pytest-html::
   
        python -m pip install pytest-html

   'chromedriver' and 'geckodriver' shall be installed and available in the $PATH for running tests on Chrome and Firefox correspondingly


**Running the tests on a local computer**

- Typical local run via Firefox and developer's CCP4Cloud (DEV server) is easy and will run all available tests ::
    
        python -m pytest ./setests/.

.. note::  if change the current directory deeply into the tests directory like ./setests/basic/, tests may fail as Python will not find some imports; always run tests from at least ./setests/



- For verbose output during a run (highly recommended, so you know what test script is doing) ::
    
        python -m pytest -v -s .

- To generate HTML reports, please do ::
    
        python -m pytest . --html report.html

- To generate JUNIT XML report (Jenkins integration, for instance) ::
   
        python -m pytest .  --junit-xml report.xml

- To specify particular test to run ::
   
        python -m pytest ./basic/test_molrep.py

- To specify a browser::
   
        python -m pytest . --browser Chrome  # Chrome or Firefox, Firefox is default

- To test other CCP4Cloud installations ::
   
        python -m pytest . --cloud https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk  # default is http://ccp4serv6.rc-harwell.ac.uk/jscofe-dev/

- You can also provide user name and password to login into CCP4Cloud ::
   
        python -m pytest . --cloud https://cloud.ccp4.ac.uk --login abcd --password efgh  # default is setests

- To test CCP4 Cloud for developers running locally, you may use following ::
   
        python -m pytest . --cloud http://localhost:8085 --login devel --password devel

- To test CCP4 Cloud Local (for instance, to test Cloud from standard CCP4 installation on Windows or Mac), you may use following. Just run CCP4 Cloud Local first and **look for correct port number instead of 12345**. Only basic tests will be run from the ./basic/directory ::
   
        python -m pytest ./basic/ -v -s --cloud http://localhost:12345 --nologin True 

- You can use any combination of all above mentioned parameters.

These tests will start the browser (controlled by Selenium) on your computer

**browser shall be on screen all the time or otherwise tests may fail! Do not change to other Desktop or full-screen programs on Mac or tests will fail.**

2. **Running the tests in remote mode.**

   - It is possible to run the browser on a remote machine (Linux VM provided by STFC Cloud) running Selenium Server Hub.

All the tests will be run remotely, locally you will get the report (the browser will not start on your local machine,
it will start on STFC Cloud VM). This Cloud machine is accessible only from STFC intranet (use VPN from home) ::

        python -m pytest . --remote http://130.246.213.187:4444/wd/hub

   - All parameters from (1) will also work in this remote mode, just add them as appropriate.

--------------------
Data for Cloud tests
--------------------

#. Directory ``test_data`` shall be copied into ``$HOME`` of the current user, so Cloud tests would be able
to upload data to the Cloud from that location (required for tests of imports and WorkFlows).
Python code addresses this as ``~/test_data`` or ``%userprofile%\\test_data`` on Windows.
It also shall be available on STFC VM running Selenium Hub.


#. Directory ``old_cloud`` shall also be copied into ``$HOME`` of the current user, so Cloud tests would be able
to import old Cloud projects to the Cloud from that location (required for 'oldproject' tests).
Python code addresses this as ``~/old_cloud`` or ``%userprofile%\\old_cloud`` on Windows.

**Only 01.ccp4cloud and 05.ccp4cloud are used, the others are kept just in case**

It also shall be available on STFC VM running Selenium Hub.


#. Contents of the directory ``test_data_cloud`` shall be in the ``ccp4@ccp4serv9.rc-harwell.ac.uk:/data1/opt/cloud_storage/test-data/``
This is 'test-data' directory of the CCP4Cloud DEV and PRE Clouds; Cloud tests do 'Cloud import' from these data.

Cloud tests are run on setest machine on https://openstack.stfc.ac.uk/auth/login/
