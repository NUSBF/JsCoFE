Linking Findmysequence to local databases

----------------------------
Findmysequence search in CCP4 Cloud
----------------------------

In CCP4 Cloud, *findmysequence* can be used to identify the sequence of a 
structure from a given electron density map. It is useful when the sequence is
unknown or the crystal structure appears to differ from the assumed sequence. 
It uses various sequence databases to assist with identifying the unknown target
sequence. For example, in CCP4 Cloud we can set it to use the `EBI 
AlphaFold Database`_ (*EBI-AFDB*). A local versions of the *EBI-AFDB* sequence 
listings (~92GBs) can be used to enable this.

Configuring Findmysequence to use local resources

**1 A local copy of the EBI-AFDB sequence listing file (sequences.fasta)**

This file, containing the complete list of the sequences of the 
predictions in the *EBI-AFDB*, is available for download from the `AFDB ftp site`_. 
Setting the **AFDB_SEQDB** environment variable in start-nc.sh to point at the
file's location on the local file system will enable findmysequnce to search the 
entire *EBI-AFDB* for hits.
