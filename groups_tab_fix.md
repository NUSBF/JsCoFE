# Groups Tab Fix in Admin Page

## Issue Description
The Groups tab in the admin page was not working correctly. When navigating away from the admin page and then returning, the system would correctly return to the admin page and remember which tab was active (e.g., Groups), but the content of the Groups tab was not being loaded properly.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the code, two issues were identified:

1. **Tab State Persistence**: While the admin page was correctly saving and restoring the active tab using localStorage, there was no mechanism to ensure that the content of the Groups tab was loaded when the tab was selected.

2. **Content Loading**: The Groups tab content was only loaded during the initial page load through the `refresh()` method, but if there were any issues with the initial data load or if the tab was selected later, the content might not be loaded properly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Tab Change Listener
Added code to the tab change listener to load the Groups tab content when the tab is selected if it hasn't been loaded yet:

```javascript
// Set up tab change listener to save the active tab and load tab content if needed
this.tabs.setTabChangeListener((ui) => {
  const tabName = $(ui.newTab).text().trim();
  localStorage.setItem('adminActiveTab', tabName);
  
  // Load tab content if needed when tab is selected
  if (tabName === 'Groups' && (!this.groupListTable || !this.groupsData)) {
    console.log('Loading Groups tab content on tab activation');
    this.loadGroupsData({
      columns: [
        // Minimal column definition to be replaced by the full definition in loadGroupsData
        { header: 'Group Name', style: { 'text-align': 'left' } }
      ],
      rows: []
    });
  }
});
```

### 2. Improved Groups Data Loading
Enhanced the `loadGroupsData` method with better error handling, logging, and a loading indicator:

- Added detailed timestamped logging to help diagnose issues
- Added a loading indicator in the tab title
- Improved error handling with more specific error messages
- Added checks to prevent creating duplicate table instances
- Added storage of the groups data for future reference

## How to Test the Fix

1. Log in to the CCP4 Cloud application
2. Navigate to the Admin page
3. Click on the "Groups" tab and verify that the content loads properly
4. Navigate away from the Admin page (e.g., to Projects page)
5. Return to the Admin page
6. Verify that the "Groups" tab is still active and its content is displayed correctly

## Benefits

- Improved user experience by ensuring the Groups tab content is always loaded when the tab is selected
- Better error handling and user feedback when there are issues loading the Groups data
- More detailed logging to help diagnose any future issues
- Consistent behavior with other tabs in the admin interface

## Technical Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility with the existing code
- The solution is robust against network errors and unexpected server responses
- The implementation follows the existing coding patterns in the application
