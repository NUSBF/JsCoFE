INSTALLATION

Please see  ./manual/html/index.html .

STOPPING jsCoFE

Currently, this may be done only by killing node instances:

> killall node

This should be done in periods when jsCoFE is idle: when it is not running any
jobs and when there is no users interacting with the system. A graceful way of
stopping jsCoFE will be provided later.
