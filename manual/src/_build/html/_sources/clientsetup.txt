MS Windows XXX

**Installation**

Installation should be performed in account with administrative privileges.

#. If you do not have CCP4 Software Series 7.0 installed on your machine,
   download CCP4 Windows installer from http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/download and
   run it. Make sure to agree to all applicable licenses.
#. Download `ccp4cloud_win64.exe <http://ccp4serv7.rc-harwell.ac.uk/jscofe-alpha/downloads/ccp4cloud_win64.exe>`_
   and run it. The installer has sensible defaults for the setup directory and
   various settings, you should not need to change them.


**Desktop shortcuts**

After successful installation, *local* (marked with airplane sign),
*remote* (marked with WiFi sign) and *configuration* (bearing gears sign)
|jsCoFE| icons should appear on your desktop. You are ready to use
|jsCoFE| -- simply double-click on the *remote* or *local* icon.

The *configuration* icon starts a configuration editor that allows you
to change web-browser, switch to different |jsCoFE| server (e.g. the one that
might have been installed in your lab) and apply updates.

Linux

**Installation**

#. Download `ccp4-7.0-setup-linux.tar.gz <http://ccp4serv7.rc-harwell.ac.uk/jscofe-alpha/downloads/ccp4-7.0-setup-linux.tar.gz>`_.
#. Unpack the archive and launch ccp4-7.0-setup-linux.
#. When CCP4 Setup Manager starts, click the "Next" button at the bottom
   of the window.
#. In the next page, choose whether to install CCP4 Software anew or just to modify
   the existing installation. In the latter case, navigate to the directory
   ``ccp4-7.0`` of the existing installation using the "Browse" button.
   Press the "Next" button.
#. In the next page, choose CCP4 components to install. For new installation,
   the required minimum is all apart from the "Balbes database" and
   "Local fold libraries". If you are modifying an existing installation, the
   already installed components will be shown as selected and you will have to
   select only those you want to add, including "CCP4 Cloud". Press the "Next"
   button to continue.
#. Next several pages present licences for CCP4 components. Read and agree to
   the licences. Keep pressing the "Next" button until you arrive at the
   directory selection page.
#. There are three ways how the directory page may be presented.
   This depends on previous choices. In case of new CCP4 setup,
   the directory page will contain an input field for installation directory.
   In case of installation of additional components, the installation directory
   is shown but is not editable. If CCP4 Cloud is the only component to be added,
   it can be installed in a different location than all other CCP4 components.
   In this case an additional input field is presented for that location.
   In all three modes the input filed is presented for temporary directory,
   which is used for downloads. The temporary directory must be writable.
#. After setting all required paths in the directory selection page, press the
   "Next" button and wait until all downloads finish, then press the "Next"
   button again.
#. When you see a window with black field in it, press "Install" button.
#. When installation finishes, press "Finish" button.

**Desktop shortcuts**

On successful installation, the installer should expose *local* (marked with
airplane sign), *remote* (marked with with WiFi sign) and *configuration*
(bearing the gears sign) |jsCoFE| icons. The *local* and *remote* icons start
|jsCoFE| in the corresponding mode, while the *configuration* icon starts
a configuration editor. The editor allows you to change the web-browser used,
switch to a different |jsCoFE| server (e.g. the one that might have been
installed in your lab) and apply updates.

In a modern Linux, you will find |jsCoFE| launchers in the "Activities" menu.
In order to find them, examine the full list of applications (the dock button
with vertical lines) or type CCP4 in the search text box. Then drug all three
|jsCoFE| launchers to the Dock or choose the "Add to Favourites" option of
their context menus. In case of older Linux versions, the launchers will
be placed on the Desktop.

In some cases you may find that provided launchers do not work. In this happens,
|jsCoFE| can be launched from terminal with one of the following commands: ::

  $ /path/to/ccp4cloud/bin/ccp4cloud-desktop.sh
  $ /path/to/ccp4cloud/bin/ccp4cloud-remote.sh

**Desktop shortcuts**

On successful installation, the installer will place *local* (marked with
airplane sign), *remote* (marked with with WiFi sign) and *configuration*
(bearing the gears sign) |jsCoFE| icons inside ``ccp4cloud`` folder found
in |jsCoFE| destination directory. The *local* and *remote* icons start
|jsCoFE| in the corresponding mode, while the *configuration* icon starts
a configuration editor. The editor allows you to change the web-browser used,
switch to a different |jsCoFE| server (e.g. the one that might have been
installed in your lab) and apply updates. Depending on the security settings
in your machine, a few more steps may be required before you can use the icons.

#. Open Finder and navigate to ``ccp4cloud`` directory, found in |jsCoFE|
   destination directory. The directory should contain application launchers
   ``ccp4cloud-remote.app``, ``ccp4cloud-desktop.app`` and ``ccp4cloud-config.app``.
   You can drag them to the location of your choice, for example, Desktop or Dock.
#. Double-click on any of the icon. If the corresponding |jsCoFE| component does
   not start, it may be that the launchers are disabled by OSX security.
   In order to enable them, go to System Preferences, then to Security and Privacy,
   and then select "Anywhere" checkbox found in in section "Allow apps downloaded from".
   After that, right-click on each |jsCoFE| icon and choose "Open" from the context
   menu. This will start |jsCoFE| components for first time, after which deselect
   checkbox "Anywhere" in the "Allow apps downloaded from" section of System
   Preferences.
#. If "Allow apps downloaded from" does not have option "Anywhere", open Terminal
   and execute command ``sudo spctl --master-disable``, then perform actions
   from p.2, and execute command ``sudo spctl --master-enable`` (details may read
   `here <http://osxdaily.com/2016/09/27/allow-apps-from-anywhere-macos-gatekeeper/>`_).
