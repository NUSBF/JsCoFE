================================
What is |jsCoFE| Client Software
================================

|jsCoFE| Client is an optional package, which is installed on your local machine
for:

  * seamless integration of CCP4 graphical applications, such as **Coot** with
    remote |jsCoFE| setups.

  * running |jsCoFE| locally on your own machine. In local mode, there is no
    connection to remote |jsCoFE| remote servers, all tasks are run on your
    machine and all your data and projects are kept on your local hard drive.



--------------------------------------------
Do I have to have |jsCoFE| Client installed?
--------------------------------------------

Remote |jsCoFE| setups are accessible via common browsers just like any ordinary
web-site, and you can do most of tasks without having Client software installed.
As an example, |jsCoFE| can be used from tablet devices and smartphones, for
which |jsCoFE| Clients do not exist.

However, without |jsCoFE| Client installed, you cannot use certain software,
such as **Coot**, directly with |jsCoFE|. There will be other functional
limitations as well, for example, you will not be able to process X-ray
diffraction images locally on your machine with either **Xia2**, **DUI/DIALS** or
**iMosflm** software. Besides, |jsCoFE| Client provides a convenient launcher and
configuration facilities.


--------------------------------------------------
How do I use |jsCoFE| Client once it is installed?
--------------------------------------------------

Simply use icon launchers, which appear after |jsCoFE| Client installation, for
starting your working session. Upon double-clicking on icon for either *remote* or *local*
mode, the Client will open a |jsCoFE| login page in chosen browser, by which time
all needed local software will be already integrated with the system, and you are
fully set to go.
