=======================
CCP4 Cloud Client Setup
=======================


----------
MS Windows
----------

**Installation**

#. If you do not have CCP4 Software Series 7.x installed on your machine, download
   CCP4 Windows installer from http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/download and run it. Make sure
   to agree to all applicable licenses and make a notice of path to the installed
   CCP4 Software.
#. Download `ccp4cloud_win64.exe <http://ccp4serv7.rc-harwell.ac.uk/jscofe-alpha/downloads/ccp4cloud_win64.exe>`_ and run it.
   The installer has sensible defaults for storage directory and features and there is no need to change them.

**Desktop shortcuts**

Successful installation should result in ``local`` (with airplane sign) and
``remote`` (WiFi sign) |jsCoFE| icons on your desktop. You are ready to use
|jsCoFE| -- simply click on the respective icon.

Linux
-----

**Installation**

#. Download `ccp4-7.0-setup-linux.tar.gz <http://ccp4serv7.rc-harwell.ac.uk/jscofe-alpha/downloads/ccp4-7.0-setup-linux.tar.gz>`_.
#. Unpack the archive and launch ``ccp4-7.0-setup-linux``.
#. If you do not have CCP4 Software Series 7.x installed on your machine, select "CCP4 Program Suite"
   in the package components page. Otherwise, provide path to your CCP4-7.x setup where requested and
   press "Next" button.
#. Select "|jsCoFE|" in the package components page.
#. If |jsCoFE| will be used in local mode (without connection to remote servers), select
   "Balbes Database" and "MoRDa" in the package components page (note that this will require extra
   7GB of disk space).
#. Run the rest of installation by pressing "Next" button in the right-bottom corner of the
   installer window, agreeing to all applicable licences and providing required paths for
   software installation.

**Desktop shortcuts**

Successful installation should result in ``local`` (with airplane sign) and
``remote`` (WiFi sign) |jsCoFE| icons placed inside the installation folder.
Navigate to the installation folder using file browser and drag the icons to
the Desktop. Current icons may be unsuitable for latest Linuxes (e.g.
``Fedora 29``), or may require the execution permissions to be set manually,
through the context menu (e.g. ``Ubuntu 16``). In the former case, |jsCoFE|
can still be launched from the command line using one of the following
commands: ::

  $ /path/to/ccp4cloud/bin/ccp4cloud-desktop.sh
  $ /path/to/ccp4cloud/bin/ccp4cloud-remote.sh


-------
Mac OSX
-------

**Installation**

#. Download `ccp4-7.0-setup.dmg <http://ccp4serv7.rc-harwell.ac.uk/jscofe-alpha/downloads/ccp4-7.0-setup.dmg>`_.
#. Double-click on ``ccp4-7.0-setup.dmg``, then right-click on CCP4 Setup Manager icon in the center of
   the popup window and choose "Open". Ignore security warnings and allow OSX to run CCP4 Setup Manager.
#. If you do not have CCP4 Software Series 7.x installed on your machine, select "CCP4 Program Suite"
   in the package components page. Otherwise, provide path to your CCP4-7.x setup where requested and
   press "Next" button.
#. Select "|jsCoFE|" in the package components page.
#. If |jsCoFE| will be used in local mode (without connection to remote servers), select
   "Balbes Database" and "MoRDa" in the package components page (note that this will require extra
   7GB of disk space).
#. Run the rest of installation by pressing "Next" button in the right-bottom corner of the
   installer window, agreeing to all applicable licences and providing required paths for
   software installation.

**Desktop shortcuts**

Successful installation should result in ``local`` (with airplane sign) and
``remote`` (WiFi sign) |jsCoFE| icons placed inside the installation folder.
Navigate to the installation folder using file browser and drag the icons to
system's Dock. Usually, system's security does not allow to run applications
downloaded from the internet from first attempt. In order to bypass this problem,
right-click on |jsCoFE| icon and choose ``Open`` from the context menu. This
needs to be done only once for every icon.
